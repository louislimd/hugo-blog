### Introduction
HCV is an RNA virus that belongs to the **flavivirus** family. There are 6 HCV genotypes with multiple subtypes. Most (60~70%) of the hepatitis c in Taiwan is due to genotype **1b**.

### Etiology
The most frequent mode of transmission is parenteral. Less common modes of transmission include high-risk sexual behavior and perinatal transmission.

### Manifestations
1. The incubation period is **1~5 months**. If symptoms occur, the average time is **6~7 weeks**.
2. Acute HCV hepatitis is defined as presenting within 6 months of the exposure to HCV.
    - 75% cases are asymptomatic; 25% cases are symptomatic.
    - There is an about 20% chance of spontaneous resolution, which may be associated with IL28B & HLA class II genotypes.
    - Symptoms vary from mild illness to fulminant hepatic failure. Nonspecific symptoms include malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever.
3. Chronic HCV hepatitis:
    - 20~30% cases develop cirrhosis after 20 years; about 5% of patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocelullar carcinoma.
    - Risk factors of developing cirrhosis include men, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection.
    - Fatigue is a common symptom.
4. Extrahepatic manifestations:
    - Cryoglobulinemia
    - Membranoproliferative glomerulopathies (MPGN)
    - Porphyria cutanea tarda (blistering rash in sun-exposed area)
    - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
    - Diabetes mellitus
    - Other: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lichen planus, cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance

### Diagnosis
1. **Antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV)**:
    - Antibodies are detected by ELISA and may be undetectable for the first 8 weeks after infection.
    - Antibodies do not confer immunity.
    - Sensitivity: 95~98%
    - False-positive test may be detected in the setting of autoimmune hepatitis or hypergammaglobulinemia.
    - False-negative test may be seen in immunosuppressed individuals and in patients on hemodialysis.
2. **HCV RNA**
    - HCV RNA can be detected by PCR as early as 1~2 weeks after infection.
    - HCV RNA determination is useful for both diagnosis and treatment purposes.
3. HCV genotypes (1~6) and subtypes can be detected for prediction of response to treatment.

> Interpretation
> 
> 1. Acute hepatitis: HCV RNA (+), anti-HCV (+/-)
> 2. Resolved hepatitis: HCV RNA (-), anti-HCV (+/-)
> 3. Chronic hepatitis: HCV RNA (+), anti-HCV (+)

### Treatment
_General principles_

1. The goal of treatment - **sustained virological response** (SVR) is defined as absence of detectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after completion of therapy.
2. Treatment should be considered in patients with chronic HCV, especially those with advanced liver disease, co-infected (HIV and HBV) patients, patients with extrahepatic manifestations, and those with recurrent HCV after liver transplantation.
3. Acute infection:
    - Monitor for spontaneous clearance, which is rare after 4 months.
    - Although pegylated IFN monotherapy induces a SVR in 80~94% of patients without ribavirin for a 24-week period independent of the genotype, current AASLD guidelines recommend to treat as described for chronic infection.
4. The selection of treatment regimen is dependent on several factors including:
    - Treatment naive or treatment experienced
    - HCV genotype and subtype
    - Stage or degree of liver fibrosis
    - Potential drug interactions
    - Comorbid conditions

_Medications_

1. **Ribavirin**: guanosine analog
2. **Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)**:
    - Nonstructural proteins 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease inhibitors (PIs): simeprevir, paritaprevir
    - NS5A inhibitors: ledipasvir, ombitasvir
    - NS5B nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: sofosbuvir, dasabuvir

_Chronic infection_

1. Genotype 1~3 are the most commonly encountered genotypes. Refer to Tables 1, 2, 3 for specific treatment recommendations.
2. Genotypes 4~6: Current recommendations suggest the following treatments for **treatment-naive** individuals.
    - Genotype 4: similar for genotype 1
    - Genotype 5: sofosbuvir + peg-IFN and weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks
    - Genotype 6: ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 12 weeks or sofosbuvir + peg-IFN and weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks
