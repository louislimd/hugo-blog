###  Indications
_Bacteria_

1. Staphylococcus aureus: Approximately 40% of infection is resistant to oxacillin.
2. Other gram positive cocci: The potency of oxacillin is about 1/10 of [penicillin G](https://louislimd.github.io/2017/03/11/penicillin-g/).
    - Streptococci
    - Viridans streptococci

_Diseases_

1. Oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (OSSA) infections, for example:
    - Bacteremia
    - Endocarditis
    - Soft-tissue infections
2. Empiric therapy for Staphylococcus aureus or streptococcal infections, for example:
    - Cellulitis
    - Impetigo

### Dosage
1. Patients with normal kidney function
    - Adult: 2g IV drip 1 hour q4h
    - Child: 150~300 mg/kg/day IV (maximum dosage = 12g/day), in 6 equally divided doses (q4h).
2. Patients with abnormal kidney function
    - Dosage adjustment is not required, since oxacillin is cleared from body by liver.
    - Additional supplement is not required for patients who just received hemodialysis or peritoneal hemodialysis.
3. For patients with severe liver dysfunction (Child C), the dosage should be decreased by 50% (by prolongation of time interval, from q4h to q8h).

### Discussion
1. Do not use oxacillin as empiric therapy for **severe Staphylococcus aureus infections**.
    - In regions where more than 20% of Staphylococcus aureus is oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), anti-ORSA antibiotics should be used as empiric therapy for Staphylococcus aureus infections. Downgrade to oxacillin or first generation cephalosporins after the infection is proved to be OSSA.
    - More than 20% of Staphylococcus aureus infections in Taiwan are ORSA.
2. When antibiotics are indicated for **OSSA infections**, oxacillin is a better choice compared to first generation cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, and even vancomycin.
    - About 95% Staphylococcus produce penicillinase.
    - Oxacillin is resistant to penicillinase.
    - Potency of first generation cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors might be attenuated in case of high-concentration penicillinase.
3. The half-life of oxacillin is only **40 minutes**. Therefore, the dosing interval should be every 4 hours (q4h), especially when oxacillin is used for treating severe infection (ex. bacterial endocarditis, bacterial meningitis, group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis).

### Adverse effect
1. Skin rash
2. Hepatitis
3. Leukopenia
    - Risk factors include liver dysfunction and chronic administration (> 2 weeks) of oxacillin.
    - If patients are treated with oxacillin over 2 weeks, the complete blood count (CBC) should be checked as routine. The treatment should be terminated once leukopenia presents.
