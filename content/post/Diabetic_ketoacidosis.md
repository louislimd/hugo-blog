### Introduction
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of diabetes, occurs in up to 5% of type 1 DM patients annually and can occur in insulin-deficient patients with type 2 DM.

### Etiology
_Pathophysiology_

DKA is a catabolic condition caused by severe insulin deficiency, often in associated with stress and elevation of counter-regulatory hormones (ex. catecholamines, glucagon). Insulin deficiency results in increasing oxidation of fatty acid, more substrate for ketogenesis and decreasing ketone clearance. In addition, hyperglycemia is resulted from increasing gluconeogenesis & glycogenolysis and decreasing glucose uptake.

_Risk factors_

- Insulin deficiency: inappropriate disruption of insulin therapy
- Glucocorticoids medication
- Infection (ex. pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis) or inflammation (ex. pancreatitis, cholecystitis)
- Ischemia or infarction
- Pregnancy
- Trauma
- Intoxication of alcohol

> Note!
> 
> - DM patients will need more insulin during sick days.
> - Euglycemic DKA (plasma glucose < 200 mg/dL) has been described in pregnancy, alocohol ingestions, fasting or starvation, during hospitalization, and in DM patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.

### Manifestations
- Patients might present symptoms including polyuria, polydypsia and dehydration. These clinical scenario also associate with hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, dercreased skin turgor and decrease of capillary filling.
- GI symptoms: nausea and vomiting, vaguely localized abdominal pain
- Kussmaul's respiration: deep, rapid, and labored breathing combined with fruity breath order.
- Respiratory distress, somnolence, stupor, shock, and coma can occur.

### Diagnosis
- **Positive serum/urine beta-hydrocybutyrate or ketones** (Caution: urine ketones may be positive in fasting normal patients)
- Hyperglycemia (except for euglycemic DKA) and hyperosmolality
- Increased BUN & creatinine
- Hyponatremia: corrected Na = measured Na + 2.4x(measured glucose - 100)/100
- Other: leukocytosis, elevated amylase
- **Metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap** can later develop into non-anion gap acidosis due to urinary loss of ketones (bicarbonate equivalents) and fluid resuscitation with chloride.

### Treatment
_Principles_

1. Close monitoring of therapy is mandatory.
2. The therapeutic priorities are **fluid replacement**, **adequate insulin administration**, and **potassium repletion**.
3. Flow sheet should be used for tracking following clinical data:
    - Vital signs: temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure
    - Urine output
    - Chemistries: sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, phosphate, BUN, creatinine, anion gap, ketones, glucose
    - Blood gases: pH, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation
    - Volume of IV fluid (past hour)
    - Insulin (units in past hour)

_Monitoring_

- Serum glucose levels should be monitored hourly; eletrolytes, BUN/Cr, pH every 2~4 hours; arterial blood gas values as frequent as needed.
- Serum sodium tends to rise as hyperglycemia is corrected; absence of this trend suggests overhydration.
- ECG can be obtained to evaluate eletrolyte disturbance and for unsuspected myocardial ischemia.

_Treating DKA_

1. **IV fluids**
    - Give 0.9% saline 10~14 mL/kg/h (alternatively 1L/h) for the first couple hours.
    - After the second or third hour, give 0.45% saline (0.9% saline if hyponatremia) 150~500 mL/h.
    - Adjust repletion according to blood pressure and urine output. The repletion should be no faster than 3 mOsm/kg/h.
    - Add dextrose 5% to the saline solution when the serum glucose less than 250 mg/dL. For patients with euglycemic DKA, dextrose should be added to IV fluids at the initiation of the therapy.
    - Aim for positive fluid balance over 12~24 hours.
2. **Insulin**
    - Do not start until K > 3.5 mmol/L
    - 0.1 U/kg IV push followed by 0.1 U/kg/h (regular insulin 100 U in 100 mL 0.9% normal saline at 10mL/h = 10 U/h)
    - Correcting blood glucose 50~75 mg/dL/h reduces risk of osmotic encephalopathy.
    - Continue until anion gap is normal, then administer subcutaneous basal insulin 2 hour prior to stopping insulin infusion.
3. **Potassium (as KCl)**
    - Add 20~40 mEq/L to IV fluid if serum potassium less than 4.5
    - Be caution if renal function remains depressed.
4. Bicarbonate
    - Not routinely recommended, but may consider in following condition: shock/coma, pH less than 7, bicarbonate less than 5 mEq/L, cardiac/respiratory dysfunction, or severe hyperkalemia.
    - 50~100 mEq in 1L 0.45% saline over 30~60 min
    - Add 10 mEq KCl can avoid hypokalemia.
5. Phosphate
    - Not routinely recommended, but may consider if phosphate less than 1 or patient not eating.

_Treating complications of DKA_

1. **Lactic acidosis** may result from prolonged dehydration, shock, infection, and tissue hypoxia. 
    - Lactic acidosis should be suspected in patients with refractory metabolic acidosis and a persistent anion gap despite optimal therapy.
    - Management includes adequate volume replacement, control of sepsis, and judicious use of bicarbonate.
2. **Arterial thrombosis** occurs with increased frequency in DKA. However routine anticoagulation is not idicated except for presence of thrombotic event.
3. **Cerebral edema** is observed more frequently in children.
    - Overhydration with free water and excessively rapid correction of hyperglycemia are known risk factors. Be aware of decreasing serum sodium level or failure to rise during therapy.
    - Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure or sudden deterioration in mental status after initial improvement should raise suspicion. Neuroimaging with a CT scan can establish diagnosis.
    - Cerebral edema can be treated with IV mannitol.
4. All patients who develop DKA require both basal and premeal insulin in adequate doses to avoid recurrence.

_Other_

IV antimicrobial therapy should be started for documented or suspected infections. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics can be started in septic patients pending results of blood cultures. Note that DKA is not typically accompanied by fever.
