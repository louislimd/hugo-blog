### Basics
1. The cardiac action potential: ![](/img/Approach_ECG_1.png)
    - **Phase 4**: At rest, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase pump maintains a stable resting membrane potential of about –90 mV. The SA node, whose cells are relatively permeable to sodium resulting in a less negative resting potential of about –55 mV.
    - **Phase 0**: There is rapid opening of sodium channels with movement of sodium into the cell
    - **Phase 1**: When membrane potential is at its most positive, the electrochemical gradient causes potassium outflow and closure of sodium channels.
    - **Phase 2**: A plateau phase follows, with membrane potential maintained by calcium influx; membrane potential falls towards the resting state as calcium channels gradually become inactive and potassium channels gradually open.
    - **Phase 3**: Potassium channels fully open, and the cell becomes repolarized.
    - **Phase 4**: Calcium, sodium and potassium are gradually restored to resting levels by their respective ATPase-dependent pumps.<!--more-->

5. The waves and intervals of the ECG correspond to the following events:
    - **P wave**: Atrial depolarization
    - **PR interval**: Start of atrial depolarization to start of ventricular depolarization
    - **QRS complex**: Ventricular depolarization
    - **ST segment**: Pause in ventricular electrical activity before repolarization
    - **T wave**: Ventricular repolarization
    - **QT interval**: Total time taken by ventricular depolarization and repolarization
    - **U wave**: Uncertain, might be interventricular septal repolarization or slow ventricular repolarization

### Preparation
1. Placement of the chest (precordial) electrodes:
    - **Electrodes V1**: 4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, right sternal edge
    - **Electrodes V2**: 4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, left sternal edge
    - **Electrodes V3**: Midway in between V2 and V4
    - **Electrodes V4**: 5<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, mid-clavicular line
    - **Electrodes V5**: Left anterior axillary line, same horizontal level as V4
    - **Electrodes V6**: Left mid-axillary line, same horizontal level as V4 and V5

### Interpretation
Systemic approach is vital for ECG interpretation. A step-by-step guide for reading ECGs is described as follows:

1. [Check the heart rate]()
    - Is the heart rate below 60/min?
    - Is the heart rate above 100/min?
2. Check the rhythm
    - Is ventricular activity present?
    - Is the ventricular rhythm regular or irregular?
    - Is the QRS complex width normal or broad?
    - Is atrial activity present?
    - How are atrial activity and ventricular activity related?
3. Check the axis
    - Is there left axis deviation?
    - Is there right axis deviation?
    - Is there extreme right axis deviation?
4. Check the PR interval
    - Is the PR interval less than 0.12 sec long?
    - Is the PR interval more than 0.2 sec long?
    - Does the PR interval vary or can it not be measured?
    - Is the PR segment elevated or depressed?
5. Check the QRS complex
    - Are any R or S waves too big?
    - Are the QRS complexes too small?
    - Are any QRS complexes too wide?
    - Are any QRS complexes an abnormal shape?
6. Check the QT interval
    - Is the QTc interval long?
    - Is the QTc interval short?
7. Check the P wave
    - Are any P waves absent?
    - Are any P waves inverted?
    - Are any P waves too tall?
    - Are any P waves too wide?
8. Check the Q wave
    - Are any pathological Q waves?
9. Check the ST segment
    - Are the ST segments elevated?
    - Are the ST segments depressed?
    - Are J waves present?
10. Check the T wave
    - Are the T waves too tall?
    - Are the T waves too small?
    - Are any of the T waves inverted?
11. Check the U wave
    - Do the U waves appear too prominent?
    - Are any of the U waves inverted?
