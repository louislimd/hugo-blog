### Introduction
1. **Total body water (TBW)**:
    - Water comprises approximately 60% of lean body weight in men and 50% in women.
    - Two-thirds of TBW is **intracellular fluid (ICF)**.
    - One-thirds of TBW is **extracellular fluid (ECF)**.
    - ECF is further subdivided into intravascular and interstitial spaces in a ratio of 1:4.
2. **Antidiuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin)**:
    - ADH permits water movement across the distal nephron.
    - Although vasopressin release is predominately responsive to osmotic cues, volume contraction can also result in a reduction of renal water excretion.
3. **Total body sodium**:
    - 85~90% of total bdy sodium is extracellular and constitutes the predominate solute in the ECF.
    - The kidney can regulate sodium reabsorption, which is mediated by cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and central nervous system sensors of effective circulating volume.

### Etiology
_Hypervolemic_

1. Hypervolemia results from a surplus of **total body sodium**.
    - Primary disorder: renal sodium retention
    - Secondary disorders (decrease of effective circulating volume): heart failure, cirrhosis, or profound hypoalbuminemia

_Hypovolemic_

1. Volume depletion generally results from a deficit in **total body sodium** content. This may result from **renal** or **extrarenal** losses from the ECF.
    - Renal losses include enhanced diuresis, salt-wasting nephropathies, mineralocorticoid deficiency, or resolution of obstructive renal disease.
    - Extrarenal losses include GI losses (vomiting, nasogastric suction, fistula drainage, diarrhea), respiratory losses, skin losses (especially with burns), hemorrhage, and severe third spacing of fluid in critically ill patients.
2. Water lossess alone is not common, since the quantity to do so is large.

### Manifestations
_Hypervolemic_

1. Symptoms: dyspnea, abdominal distension, or swelling of extremities
2. Expansion of interstitial compartment: peripheral edema, ascites, and pleural effusions
3. Expansion of intravascular compartment: pulmonary rales, elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatojugular reflex, an S3 gallop, and elevated blood pressure.

_Hypovolemic_

1. Symptoms: complaints of thirst, fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps, and postural dizziness
2. Signs: low jugular venous pressure, postural hypotension, postural tachycardia, and the absence of axillary sweat. (Diminished skin turgor and dry mucous membranes are poor markers.)
3. Syncope, coma, mental status changes, oliguria, and hypovolemic shock can result with severe volume depletion.

### Diagnosis
_Hypervolemic_

1. Laboratory studies are generally not needed.
2. The urine sodium may be less than **15 mEq/L**.
3. A chest X-ray may show pulmonary edema or pleural effusions, but clear lung fields do not exclude volume overload.

_Hypovolemic_

1. Urine sodium:
    - Urine sodium > **15 mEq/L**
    - FeNa (=[Urine sodium/Serum sodium]/[Urine creatinine/Serum creatinine]) < **1%**
2. Urine osmolality and serum bicarbonate levels may be elevated.
3. Hematocrit and serum albumin may be increased.

_Hypervolemic_

1. Thiazides:
    - They block the NaCl transporters in the distal convoluted tubule.
    - They are often used for mild states of chronic sodium retention.
    - They often stimulate a responsive increase in proximal tubule reabsorption.
2. Loop diuretics:
    - They block the Na-K-2Cl transporters in the thick descending loop of Henle.
    - They are often used in circumstances requiring a brisk and immediate diuresis, such as acute volume overload.
    - They enhance the excretion of divalent cations (calcium and magnesium).
3. Potassium-sparing diuretics:
    - They decrease sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct.
    - The overall diuretic effect is comparitively small.
    - Aldosterone antagonists can be particularly useful in those with decreased renal perfusion or impaired tubular function.
4. Limiting sodium intake
5. Treatment of the underlying disease is critical to prevent continued sodium reabsorption in the kidney.

_Euvolemic_

1. The best way to maintain homeostasis is to allow free access to food and oral fluids. Patients who are unable to tolerate oral input require IV fluids.
2. Fluid administration should be reassessed at least daily. Patient weight should be monitored.
3. Minimum water requirements is roughly **1400 mL/day** or **60 mL/hour**.
    - Minimum urine output: The amount of solute consumed each day (600~800 mOsm/day) divided by maximum urine concentrating capacity (1200 mOsm/L) is at least 0.5 L/day.
    - Stool water loss: about 200 mL/day
    - Insensible water loss (from skin and respiratory tract): about 400~500 mL/day. Water losses increase by 100~150 mL/day for each degree of body temperature over 37'C.
    - Fluid from drain losses and water produced from endogenous metabolism (less than 250~350 mL/day) should be considered as well.
4. Electrolytes
    - **Sodium**: It is customary to provide **75~175 mEq/day** (or **1~2 mEq/kg**) as NaCl. (2-g sodium diet provides 86 mEq/day.)
    - **Potassium**: Generally, **20~60 mEq/day** (or **1~2 mEq/kg**) is included if renal function is normal.
    - Carbohydrate in the form of **dextrose**, **100~150 g/day**, is given to minimize protein catabolism and prevent starvation ketoacidosis.

_Hypovolemic_

1. Therapy is empiric, requiring frequent reassessment of volums status during resuscitation.
2. **Normal saline (0.9% NaCl)** remains entirely in the ECF space. It is the initial fluid of choice for replenishing **intravascular volume**.
3. **Half-normal saline (0.45% NaCl)**: half of this solution will stay in the ECF, and half will follow the predicted distribution of water.
4. In patients with hemorrhage or GI bleeding, **blood transfusion** can accomplish both volume expansion and correction of anemia.
