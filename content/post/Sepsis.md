### Introduction
Sepsis and septic shock are mediacl emergencies and treatment should be initiated immediately.

### Etiology
Septic shock is caused by the systemic release of cytokines and other immunomodulatory mediators by circulating bacteria or bacterial byproducts, resulting in profound vasodilation and compensatory increased cardiac output.

### Manifestations
1. **Systemic inflammatory response syndrome** (SIRS): Two or more of the following findings present:
    - Temperature > **38'C** or < **36'C**
    - Pulse rate > **90** beats/minute
    - White blood cell count < **4000** or > **12000** or > **10%** immature bands
    - Respiratory rate > **20** breaths/minute or PaCO2 < **32** mmHg
2. **Sepsis**: SIRS + suspected infection
3. **Severe sepsis**: Sepsis + organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion or hypotension 
4. **Septic shock**: Sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, along with signs of hypoperfusion.

> Note!
> 
> 1. End-organ dysfunction, including, but not limited to:
>     - Urine output <= 50mL/kg/hour
>     - Hepatic dysfunction, as evidenced by abnormal hepatic enzymes
>     - Altered mental status
>     - Platelet count <= 80,000
>     - pH <= 7.30 and plasma lactate >= 4 mmol/L
> 2. Refractory hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <= **90** mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <= **70** mmHg that does not improve following adequate fluid resuscitation of **30** mL/kg ideal body weight IV crystalloid fluid or requires vasopressors to maintain adequate MAP.

### Treatment
_Workup_

1. Preparation:
    - Placement of arterial line, IV line, and central venous catheter
    - Endotracheal intubation (if the patient presents with respiratory failure or coma)
    - Microbiologic cultures (including blood)
    - Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics
    - Check laboratory data (including lactate)
2. Fluid resuscitation:
    - 30 mL/kg IBW IV crystalloid fluid within the first 3 hours
    - Using albumin (20% 250 mL) in addition to crystalloids can be considered.
    - Goal: central venous pressure (CVP) < 8 mmHg (< 12 mmHg if endotracheal tube is inserted), or stroke volume variation > 13%
3. Vasoactive agents:
    - First line therapy: norepinephrine 35~90 mcg/min
    - Second line therapy: vasopressin up to 0.03 U/min
    - Third line therapy: epinephrine 25~50 mcg/min
    - Dopamine can be an alternative only in highly selected patients (e.g., patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia).
    - Goal: **mean arterial pressure (MAP) >= 65 mmHg**, or systemic vascular resistance index (80x[MAP-CVP]/cardiac index) < 1970
4. Additional therapies:
    - Administer dobutamine (2~20 mcg/kg/min) in patients with persistent hypoperfusion (cardiac index < 2.5 L/min/m^2) despite adequate fluid loading and the use of vasopressor agents.
    -  RBC transfusion occur only when hemoglobin concentration decreases to < 7.0 g/dL in adults in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage.
5. **Lactate normalization**
6. Organ support therapy:
    - Glucose control: â‰¤ 180 mg/dL
    - Renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute kidney injury
    - Mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
    - Early trophic/hypocaloric or early full enteral feeding (< 500 kcal/day)
    - Stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists
    - Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)

_Other considerations_

1. Antimicrobial treatment duration of 7 to 10 days is adequate for most serious infections.
2. Procalcitonin levels can be used to support the discontinuation of empiric antibiotics.
3. Use hydrocortisone 200 mg IV daily in divided doses only if hypotension is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.
4. Prophylactic platelet transfusion is suggested when:
    - Platelet counts are < 10 (10^9/L) in the absence of apparent bleeding
    - Platelet counts are < 20 (10^9/L) if the patient has a significant risk of bleeding
    - Higher platelet counts (>= 50 [10^9/L]) are advised for active bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures.
5. Mechanical ventilation
    - Use a target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) in adult patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.
    - Use an upper limit goal for plateau pressures of 30 cm H2O in adult patients with sepsis-induced severe ARDS.
    - Use higher PEEP over lower PEEP in adult patients with sepsis-induced moderate to severe ARDS.
    - Use lower tidal volumes in adult patients with sepsis-induced respiratory failure without ARDS.
    - Patients should be maintained with the head of the bed elevated between 30 and 45 degrees to limit aspiration risk and to prevent the development of ventilation-associated pneumonia.
