## Introduction
## Epedimiology
## Etiology
Approximately 75~80% of pancreatitis cases can be explained on the basis of gallstone disease (usually < 5 mm) or alcohol abuse. Less common causes include trauma, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and a variety of drugs.
-Gallstones: female > male, accounts for ~40% patients
-Alocohol abuse: male > female, accounts for ~30% patients
-Drugs: steroids, sulfonamides, furosemide, and thiazides
-Obstructive: tumors, annular pancreas, pancreas divisum with concurrent minor papilla stenosis
-Metabolic: hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia (can be seen in type I, IV, and V famalial hyperlipidemia)
-Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis: accounts for 5~10% patients
