### Introduction
Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissue. The inflammatory process is caused by activation of pancreatic enzymes (particularly trypsin). Autodigestion by these enzymes often leads to fat necrosis.

### Etiology
Approximately 75~80% of pancreatitis cases can be explained on the basis of **gallstone disease** or **alcohol abuse**. Less common causes include trauma, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and a variety of drugs.

Potential causes:

- Gallstones: Gallstones with a diameter of less than 5 mm are significantly more likely than larger stones to pass through the cystic duct and cause obstruction at the ampulla. Gallstone pancreatitis is more common in female.
- Alocohol abuse
- Drugs: steroids, sulfonamides, furosemide, and thiazides
- Obstructive: tumors, annular pancreas, pancreas divisum with concurrent minor papilla stenosis
- Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis: Post-ERCP pancreatitis occurs in 5~10% of patients undergoing ERCP; prophylaxis with rectal NSAIDS (indomethacin 100 mg) or topical epinephrine and placement of prophylactic duct stents can help prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.
- Infections: Mumps, coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, mycoplasma, candida, cryptococcus, and toxoplasmosis have been implicated.
- Other: Other causes include ischemia and duodenal ulcer.

### Manifestations
_Clinical presentation_

Symptoms consist of **epigastric abdominal pain radiating to back**, nausea, and vomiting. The epigastric pain is often constant and can be relieved by leaning forward. Systemic manifestations can include fever, shortness of breath, altered mental status, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances, especially with severe episodes. Rigid abdomen with epigastric guarding is more common in severe cases. Patient might mentions recent cosumption of a heavy meal, many times with generous quantities of alocoholic beverages.

_Physical examination_

Retroperitoneal hemorrhage caused by severe inflammation and necrosis can lead to fluid losses, hypotension, tachycardia, and shock.

1. **Turner sign**: Blood dissection extends to the flank, resulting in flank ecchymosis.
2. **Cullen sign**: Blood dissects up the falciform ligament and creates a periumbilical ecchymosis.

### Diagnosis
_Differential diagnosis_

- Acute cholecystitis
- Duodenal ulcer
- Intestinal obstruction
- Mesenteric ischemia
- Inferior myocardial infarction
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm leak
- Distal aortic dissection
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy

_Laboratories_

1. **Lipase**
    - Elevated beyond 3 times the upper limit of normal.
    - Serum lipase is more specific and sensitive than serum amylase.
    - False positive: renal failure, other abdominal process, diabetic ketoacidosis, HIV, macrolipasemia
2. **Amylase**
    - Elevated beyond 3 times the upper limit of normal.
    - False positive: other abdominal/salivary gland process, acidemia, renal failure, macroamylasemia
    - False negative: acute onset in chronic pancreatitis (ex. alcohol abuse), hypertriglyceridemia (since amylase activity is decreased)
3. Other
    - ALT elevated beyond 3 times the upper limit of normal may identify gallstone pancreatitis.
    - Lipid panel may suggest hypertriglyceridemia as a cause.
    - For those with abnormal renal function, amylase-to-creatinine ratio > 5 strongly suggests pancreatitis.
    - Elevated: WBC, BUN, CRP, glucose
    - Decreased: Ca

_Imaging_

1. Upper abdominal plain films/Chest radiographs: Relatively insensitive for dianosis.
    - "Cut off" sign: Area of colonic spasm adjacent to an inflamed pancreas causes the gas in the transverse colon to end abruptly.
    - Chest radiographs: Approximately 1/3 of patients have abnormalities such as pleural effusions and basal atelectasis.
2. **Ultrasound imaging**:
    - US may be particularly useful to investigate biliary etiology (ex. gallstones and bile duct dilation).
    - In approximately 25~35% of patients, excessive bowel gas due to an ileus precludes evaluation.
3. **CT scan**:
	- Contrast-enhanced CT scan can be performed three or more days after the onset of abdominal pain to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis and predict the severity of the disease.
    - Pancreatic necrosis is recognized as lack of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration.
    - Patients with a CT severity index > 5 (Table-1, Table-2) were 8 times more likely to die, 17 times more likely to have prolonged hospital stay, and 10 times more likely to need necrosectomy.
4. Magnetic resonance (MR):
    - MRI with gadolinium: Failure of the pancreatic parenchyma to enhance indicates pancreatic necrosis.
    - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is useful to detect a biliary source for pancreatitis.
