### Introduction
Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissue. The inflammatory process is caused by activation of pancreatic enzymes (particularly trypsin). Autodigestion by these enzymes often leads to fat necrosis.

### Etiology
Approximately 75~80% of pancreatitis cases can be explained on the basis of **gallstone disease** or **alcohol abuse**. Less common causes include trauma, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and a variety of drugs.

Potential causes:

- Gallstones: Gallstones with a diameter of less than 5 mm are significantly more likely than larger stones to pass through the cystic duct and cause obstruction at the ampulla. Gallstone pancreatitis is more common in female.
- Alocohol abuse
- Drugs: steroids, sulfonamides, furosemide, and thiazides
- Obstructive: tumors, annular pancreas, pancreas divisum with concurrent minor papilla stenosis
- Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis: Post-ERCP pancreatitis occurs in 5~10% of patients undergoing ERCP; prophylaxis with rectal NSAIDS (indomethacin 100 mg) or topical epinephrine and placement of prophylactic duct stents can help prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.
- Infections: Mumps, coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, mycoplasma, candida, cryptococcus, and toxoplasmosis have been implicated.
- Other: Other causes include ischemia and duodenal ulcer.

### Manifestations
_Clinical presentation_

Symptoms consist of **epigastric abdominal pain radiating to back**, nausea, and vomiting. The epigastric pain is often constant and can be relieved by leaning forward. Systemic manifestations can include fever, shortness of breath, altered mental status, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances, especially with severe episodes. Rigid abdomen with epigastric guarding is more common in severe cases. Patient might mentions recent cosumption of a heavy meal, many times with generous quantities of alocoholic beverages.

_Physical examination_

Retroperitoneal hemorrhage caused by severe inflammation and necrosis can lead to fluid losses, hypotension, tachycardia, and shock.

1. **Turner sign**: Blood dissection extends to the flank, resulting in flank ecchymosis.
2. **Cullen sign**: Blood dissects up the falciform ligament and creates a periumbilical ecchymosis.

### Diagnosis
_Differential diagnosis_

- Acute cholecystitis
- Duodenal ulcer
- Intestinal obstruction
- Mesenteric ischemia
- Inferior myocardial infarction
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm leak
- Distal aortic dissection
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy

_Laboratories_

1. **Lipase**
    - Elevated beyond 3 times the upper limit of normal.
    - Serum lipase is more specific and sensitive than serum amylase.
    - False positive: renal failure, other abdominal process, diabetic ketoacidosis, HIV, macrolipasemia
2. **Amylase**
    - Elevated beyond 3 times the upper limit of normal.
    - False positive: other abdominal/salivary gland process, acidemia, renal failure, macroamylasemia
    - False negative: acute onset in chronic pancreatitis (ex. alcohol abuse), hypertriglyceridemia (since amylase activity is decreased)
3. Other
    - ALT elevated beyond 3 times the upper limit of normal may identify gallstone pancreatitis.
    - Lipid panel may suggest hypertriglyceridemia as a cause.
    - For those with abnormal renal function, amylase-to-creatinine ratio > 5 strongly suggests pancreatitis.
    - Elevated: WBC, BUN, CRP, glucose
    - Decreased: Ca

_Imaging_

1. Upper abdominal plain films/Chest radiographs: Relatively insensitive for dianosis.
    - "Cut off" sign: Area of colonic spasm adjacent to an inflamed pancreas causes the gas in the transverse colon to end abruptly.
    - Chest radiographs: Approximately 1/3 of patients have abnormalities such as pleural effusions and basal atelectasis.
2. **Ultrasound imaging**:
    - US may be particularly useful to investigate biliary etiology (ex. gallstones and bile duct dilation).
    - In approximately 25~35% of patients, excessive bowel gas due to an ileus precludes evaluation.
3. **CT scan**:
	- Contrast-enhanced CT scan can be performed three or more days after the onset of abdominal pain to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis and predict the severity of the disease.
    - Pancreatic necrosis is recognized as lack of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration.
    - Patients with a CT severity index > 5 (Table-1) were 8 times more likely to die, 17 times more likely to have prolonged hospital stay, and 10 times more likely to need necrosectomy.
4. Magnetic resonance (MR):
    - MRI with gadolinium: Failure of the pancreatic parenchyma to enhance indicates pancreatic necrosis.
    - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is useful to detect a biliary source for pancreatitis.
    
### Treatment
_Nonoperative therapies_

- Supportive therapy should be undertaken in mild cases, with careful monitoring of fluid balance, urine output, and serum electrolytes (including calcium and glucose). Be aware of respiratory distress due to pleural effusions.
- **Intravenous (IV) fluids**: Fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (at least 250 mL/hour, up to 10 L/day) may be superior to normal saline. However, lactated Ringer's is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcemia. Adequate fluid replacement can be assessed by an improvement in vital signs (heart rate < 120 beats/minute, mean arterial pressure between 65~85 mmHg) and urine output (0.5~1 cc/kg/hour).
- Patients should receive **nothing PO** until they are free of pain and nausea. NG suction is reserved for patients with ileus or protracted emesis. If the patient is expected to receive NPO > 7 days, enteral nutrition with nasojejunal tube (can be replaced by NG tube if not possible) within 24 to 48 hours is indicated.
- **Pain control**: IV meperidine, morphine, or hydromorphone.
- Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended in the absence of systemic infection.

_Surgical management_

- Severe pancreatitis is usually managed nonoperatively except for persistent biliary obstruction due to stones, abscess or sepsis, or failure to improve.
- Urgent ERCP and sphincterotomy within 72 hours is reserved for severe cholangitis/sepsis caused by obstructive bile duct stones.
- Cholecystectomy should be performed after recovery in patients with gallstone pancreatitis.
- Necrotizing pancreatitis often requires minimally-invasive debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics for Gram negative rods (carbapenems or a combination of fluoroquinolone and metronidazole have good penetration into necrotic tissue).

### Complications
- Systemic: shock, renal failure, GI hemorrhage
- Metabolic: hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperglycemia
- Pulmonary complications: acute respiratory distress syndrome, pleural effusions, atelectasis, pneumonia
- Local complications:
    - Acute peri-pancreatic fluid collection: Peripancreatic fluid without capsule formation, usually seen within the first 4 weeks. No treatment is required.
    - Pseudocyst: An encapsulated collection of fluid, usually occurs more than 4 weeks. Pseudocyst is suggested by persistent pain or elevated amylase/lipase levels. Decompression of symptomatic or infected pseudocysts can be performed by percutaneous, endoscopic, or surgical techniques.
    - Acute necrosis collection: A heterogeneous collection containing both fluid and necrosis without definable wall, usually seen within 4 weeks.
    - Walled-off necrosis: A mature, encapsulated collection of necrosis that has developed a well-defined wall, usually occurs > 4 weeks after onset of necrotizing pancreatitis.

### Prognosis
- Severe pancreatitis occurs in 20% of patients and is defined as episodes with organ failure or local complications.
- HAPS: no abdominal tenderness or rebound on exam plus normal hematocrit and creatinine on admission pedicts non-severe course with 98% accuracy
- **Ranson's criteria**: See Table-2
- **APACHE II score**: severe if score >= 8
