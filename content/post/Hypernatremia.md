### Introduction
- Hypernatremia is defined as plasma sodium > **145 mEq/L** and represents a state of hyperosmolality.
- Hypernatremia may be caused by infusion of hypertonic fluid or loss of hypotonic fluid (dehydration), the latter being much more common.
- **Impaired thirst response** is often due to physical restrictions (institutionalized, handicapped, postoperative, or intubation) or mental impairment (delirium, dementia)

### Etiology
_Extrarenal water loss_

1. **Insensible loss**: fever, exercise, ventilation
2. **Gastrointestinal water loss**: osmotic diarrhea (induced by lactulose, sorbitol, or malabsorption of carbohydrate), vomiting, viral gastroenteritis, nasogastric tube drainage, fistula

_Renal water loss_

1. **Osmotic diuresis**: glycosuria, high osmolar feeds, increased urea generation from accelerated catabolism, high-protein feeds, stress-dose steroids, loop diuretics
2. **Diabetes insipidus**:
    - **Central diabetes insipidus (CDI)** is caused by vasopressin deficiency. The causes of CDI include destruction of the neurohypophysis from trauma, neurosurgery, granulomatous disease, neoplasms, vascular accidents, infection, IgG4-related disease, hypoxic encephalopathy, anorexia, alcohol abuse, or idiopathic.
    - **Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI)** is caused by resistance to vasopressin. The causes of NDI include inherited disorders (ADH receptor V2 mutation, aquaporin-2 mutation), drugs (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin, foscarnet, cidofovir), electrolytes disorders (hypercalcemia, severe hypokalemia), protein malnutrition, postobstructive diuresis, tubulointerstitial diseases (recovery phase of acute tubular necrosis, polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, Sjogren's syndrome, amyloidosis), pregnancy (placental vasopressinase).

_Other_

1. **Sodium overload**: hypertonic saline administration, chronic mineralocorticoid excesss
2. **Transcellular water shift** from ECF to ICF can occur in circumstances of transient intracellular hyperosmolality, as in seizures or rhabdomyolysis.

### Manifestations
- Hypernatremia results in contraction of brain cells as water shifts to ECF. Thus, the most severe symptoms of hypernatremia are neurologic, including altered mental status, weakness, neuromuscular irritability, focal neurolgic deficits, and, occasionally, coma or seizures.
- Chronic hypernatremia is generally less symptomatic.
- CDI and NDI generally present with complaints of polyuria and thirst. Signs of volume depletion or neurologic dysfunctionare generally absent unless the patient has an associated thirst abnormality.
