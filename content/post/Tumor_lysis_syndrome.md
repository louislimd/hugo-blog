### Introduction

<!--more-->
### Etiology

### Manifestations
There is typically elevated creatinine, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia.

### Diagnosis
A ratio of urine uric acid to urine creatinine that is > 1 is consistent with this diagnosis, as is the finding of uric acid crystals in the urine sediment.

### Treatment
- Prophylaxis with allopurinol 600 mg can decrease uric acid production.
- Rasburicase (15 mg/kg IV) is highly effective at depleting uric acid levels and can be given as prophylaxis or as treatment.
- Alkalinization of the urine should be avoided if hyperphosphatemia is present because this could increase risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in the urine.
