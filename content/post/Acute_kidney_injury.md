### Introduction
1. There is no precise definition for acute kidney injury (AKI), but it may be characterized by:
    - Abrupt increase (within **48 hours**) in serum creatinine more than **0.3 mg/dL** or more than **50%** from baseline.
    - Urine output less than **0.5 mL/kg/h for over 6 hours**.
2. Be aware that serum creatinine does not accurately reflect the GFR in a patient with unstable kidney function.

### Etiology
_Prerenal disease_

Prerenal disease characterized by preserved intrinsic renal function in the setting of renal hypoperfusion and reduced GFR. Possible causes include:

1. Decrease of effective arterial volume:
    - Hypovolemia
    - Congestive heart failure
    - Sepsis
    - Hepatic cirrhosis (can progress to hepatorenal syndrome)
2. Renal vasoconstriction can be caused by:
    - [Hepatorenal syndrome](): Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, overdiuresis, gastrointestinal bleeding, large volume paracentesis without volume expansion, or systemic bacterial infections can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhotic patients.
    - Hypercalcemia
    - Drugs: NSAIDs, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, contrast, and calcineurin inhibitors
3. Obstruction of large vessels:
    - Renal artery stenosis
    - Venous thromboembolus, vasculitis or dissection of large vessels that supply kidney
    - Abdominal compartment syndrome

_Intrinsic disease_

Intrinsic renal disease involves the glomeruli, microvasculature, tubules, or interstitium of the kidneys. Possible causes include:

1. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN):
    - **Ischemic ATN** is the most common (~50%) cause of renal failure in the intensive care setting and is the end result of any process that leads to hypoperfusion of kidneys.
    - Toxic ATN results from drugs (ex. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin)
    - Pigment nephropathy (ex. hemoglobin, myoglobin) results from direct tubular toxicity and vasoconstriction.
    - Toxic ATN results from light chain of immunoglobulin
    - Crystal-induced AKI (ex. uric acid, methotrexate, acyclovir, indinavir; [tumor lysis syndrome]())
    - **Contrast-induced acute kidney injury**: Risk factors include chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, volume depletion, higher contrast volumes, and use of hyperosmolar contrast.
2. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN):
    - Allergy caused by beta-lactams, sulfa drugs, NSAIDs, allopurinol, or proton pump inhibitors
    - Pyelonephritis (uncommon): bilateral involvement is usually necessary to induce a rise in creatinine.
    - Infection, such as streptococcal infection, leptospirosis, TB, or legionella
    - Infiltrative diseases result from sarcoid, lymphoma, or leukemia
    - Autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, TINU syndrome (tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis), systemic lupus erythematosus, IgG4-related diseases
3. Obstruction of small/medium vessels:
    - Cholesterol embolism: can be seen in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis
    - Polyarteritis nodosa
    - Thrombotic microangiopathy: hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, preeclampsia, antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome, malignant hypertension, or scleroderma renal crisis
4. Glomerular diseases, such as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (See more information in "[Glomerulopathies]()").

_Postrenal disease_

Postrenal disease involves obstruction of the urinary collecting system. Bilateral involvement or unilateral obstruction to a solitary kidney is required to produce a significant change in creatinine level. Possible causes include:

1. Obstruction at bladder neck:
    - Benign prostate hyperplasia
    - Prostate cancer
    - Neurogenic bladder
    - Anticholinergic medications
2. Ureteral obstruction:
    - Malignancy
    - Lymphadenopathy
    - Retroperitoneal fibrosis
    - Nephrolithiasis

### Manifestations
1. Prerenal disease
    - When the cause is **true volume depletion**, physical exam may reveal dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and orthostatic signs (drop in blood pressure > 20 / 10 mmHg or an increase in heart rate by 10 bpm after standing from a seated/lying position). The central venous pressure is typically less than 8 cmH2O.
2. Intrinsic disease
    - **Contrast-induced AKI**: The creatinine typically rises 25% or 0.5 mg/dL within 24~48 hours, peak in 3~5 days, and resolves in 7~10 days.
    - **Gadolinium** can cause AKI and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with stage IV chronic kidney disease. The latent period between exposure and disease onset is usually 2~4 weeks. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may involve skin, joints, eyes, and internal organs.
    - **Aminoglycoside nephropathy** is typically nonoliguric and results in renal wasting of potassium and magnesium. A similar pattern of potassium and magnesium loss is seen in **cisplatin toxicity**.
    - **Rhabdomyolysis**: The creatinine kinase (CK) level is elevated to at least 10 times the upper limit of normal with a disproportionate rise in creatinine, potassium, and phosphorus.
    - **Tumor lysis syndrome**: There is typically elevated creatinine, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia.
    - **Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**: A nephritic picture is common, with RBC casts, edema, and hypertension.
    - **Choleterol embolism**: Physical findings may include retinal arteriolar plaques, lower extremity livedo reticularis, and areas of digital necrosis. Many patients progress to chronic kidney disease and even to end-stage renal disease.
    - **AIN**: The classic triad of fever, rash, eosinophilia is seen in less than 1/3 of patients.
3. Postrenal disease
    - Relief of bilateral obstruction is frequently followed by **postobstructive diuresis**.

### Diagnosis
_Workup_

To identify the cause of acute kidney injury, initial evaluation should include following workup:

1. History & Physical examination
    - Vital signs and hydration status?
    - History of systemic or vascular disease?
    - Recent procedures and medications?
    - Signs and symptoms of urinary tract obstruction?
2. Urine evaluation
    - Output
    - Urinalysis, electrolytes and osmolality
    - **Sediment**: Muddy brown granular casts suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN), WBC casts suggest an inflammatory or infectious interstitial process, and RBC casts suggest glomerular disease. Identification of crystals in the urine may suggest crystal-induced AKI.
3. **Fractional excretion of sodium** (FENa) = (Urine Na/Plasma Na)/(Urine creatinine/Plasma creatinine). The interpretation of FENa and other parameters is briefly summarized in Table-1.

Table-1 Laboratory findings and diagnosis of acute kidney injury

Loop diuretics and metbolic alkalosis can induce natriuresis, increase the FENa, and mask the presence of renal hypoperfusion. The FEUN can instead be calculated in these settings. Be aware that contrast and pigment nephropathy can result in a low FENa due to early vasoconstriction ("prerenal" drop in perfusion). The FENa also has limited utility when AKI is superimposed on chronic kidney disease.

4. Renal ultrasound or CT
    - Rule out obstruction
    - Evaluate kidney size to estimate chronicity of kidney disease
5. Serologies if indicated (See more information in "[Glomerulopathies]()")
6. Renal biopsy may be necessary if cause remains unclear, especially if hematuria or proteinuria present.

_Other_

1. Prerenal disease
    - An intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg, measured via a pressure transducer attached to the bladder catheter, suggests the diagnosis of **abdominal compartment syndrome**.
2. Intrinsic disease
    - **ATN**: Pigmented granular muddy brown casts in about 75% patients.
    - **Pigment nephropathy**: The diagnosis may be suspected by a positive urine dipstick test for blood but an absence of RBCs on microscopic examination.
    - **Tumor lysis syndrome**: A ratio of urine uric acid to urine creatinine that is > 1 is consistent with this diagnosis, as is the finding of uric acid crystals in the urine sediment (See more information in "[Tumor lysis syndrome]()").
    - **AIN**: Urine WBCs, WBC casts, with negative urine culture results.
    - **Allergic interstitial disease caused by antibiotics**: Eosinophil may be seen in urine.
    - **Allergic interstitial disease caused by NSAIDs**: Lymphocyte may be seen in urine. Nephrotic range proteinuria might occur as well.
    - **Pyelonephritis**: Urine findings include pyuria and WBC casts.
    - **Cholesterol embolism**: Eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and hypocomplementemia may be present, and WBC casts maty be found in the urine sediment. However, in many cases, the only laboratory abnormality is a rising creatinine follows a stepwise progression. Renal biopsy shows cholesterol clefts in the small arteries.
    - **Glomerulonephritis**: Dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts may be seen in urine (See more information in "[Glomerulopathies]()").
3. Postrenal disease
    - Most causes of postrenal disease are identified on ultrasound by dilation of the collecting system. Be aware that hydronephrosis may be less pronounced when there is concomitant volume depletion or if peritoneal fibrosis has encased the ureters, preventing their expansion.
    - When urethral flow is impeded by **prostatic enlargement**, placement of a bladder catheter can be both diagnostic and therapeutic; a postvoid residual urine volume **> 300 mL** strongly suggests the diagnosis.

### Treatment
General principles include:

- Volume status must be evaluated to correct for hypovolemia or hypervolemia (See more information in "[Fluid management and volume status]()").
- Watch out for electrolyte imbalances (ex. potassium, phosphorus) and acid-base disturbance.
- Mild metabolic acidosis can be treated with oral sodium bicarbonate, 650~1300 mg thrice daily. Severe acidosis (pH less than 7.2) can be temporized with IV sodium bicarbonate but requires monitoring for volume overload, rebound alkalosis, and hypocalcemia.
- Avoid nephrotoxic insults and review dosing of renally cleared drugs.

> Indications of hemodialysis in patients with AKI:
> - Anuria (negligible urine output for 6h)
> - Severe oliguria (urine output < 200mL over 12h)
> - Hyperkalemia (> 6.5 mmol/L)
> - Severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2 with normal or low PaCO2)
> - Volume overload (especially pulmonary edema unresponsive to diuretics)
> - Pronounced azotemia (BUN > 80 mg/dL, Cr > 3.0 mg/dL)
> - Clinical complications for uremia (ex. encephalopathy, pericarditis, neuropathy)
> - Intoxication of methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, salicylates

Disease-specific therapies will be discussed below. 

1. Prerenal disease
    - **Hepatorenal syndrome**: Management of the renal disease is supportive. Temporizing measures include treatment of the underlying precipitating factor (ex. peritonitis) and withholding diuretics. Dialytic support can be used as a bridge to transplantation in appropriate candidates. See more information in [Hepatorenal syndrome]().
    - In AKI caused by **heart failure**, diuresis may improve the prerenal azotemia.
2. Intrinsic disease
    - Management of **ATN** is supportive. Volume deficits, if present, should be corrected. If volume overload and oliguria become evident, a diuretic challenge is reasonable (typically IV furosemide 40~120 mg boluses or a continuous drip at 10~20 mg/h). It may take 1~2 weeks to recover from ATN.
    - **Crystal-induced AKI** is typically treated by supportive care after the offending agent is discontinued.
    - **Contrast-induced AKI**: Preventive measures include discontinuation of ACEI/ARB, NSAIDs, diuretics; and periprocedure hydration. Sodium bicarbonate at 150 mEq/L (3 ampules in 5% dextrose in water) can be given at 3 mL/kg/h for 1 hour prior to exposure, then at 1 mL/kg/h for 6 hours afterwards. Remember to minimize contrast volume and consider iso-osmolar contrast.
    - **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis**: No effective prophylaxis or standard treatment. Kidney transplantation can be considered.
    - **Aminoglycoside toxicity**: Replacement of potassium and magnesium may be necessary. Risk may be minimized by avoiding volume depletion.
    - **Rhabdomyolysis**: Aggressive IV fluid administration (consider isotonic saline at 1~2L/h) should be initiated immediately. After urine flow is established, alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (150 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate mixed with 1 L of 5% dextrose in water) might be helpful if severe hypocalcemia is not present, arterial pH less than 6.5, and serum bicarbonate less than 30 mEq/L. If bicarbonate is given, arterial pH and serum calcium should be monitored every 2 hours.
    - **Tumor lysis syndrome**: See more information in "[Tumor lysis syndrome]()"
    - **Cholesterol embolism**: No specific treatment is available. Anticoagulation may worsen embolic disease.
    - **AIN**: Withdraw the offending agent. Temporary dialytic support may be necessary in severe cases. A short course of prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day may hasten recovery.
    - **Pyelonephritis**: antibiotic therapy is guided by culture results.
3. Postrenal disease
    - When the **upper urinary tract** is obstructed, decompression is necessary, with stenting or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
    - **Postobstructive diuresis**: Serum electrolytes need to be monitored if polyuria ensues, and replacement of approximately half of the urinary volume with 0.45% saline is recommended. Watch out for secondary buildup of BUN and tubular damage.
    - Hemorrhagic cystitis can be avoid by slow decompression.
