### Introduction
1. There is no precise definition for acute kidney injury (AKI), but it may be characterized by:
    - Abrupt increase (within 48 hours) in serum creatinine more than 0.3 mg/dL or more than 50% from baseline.
    - Urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for over 6 hours.
2. Be aware that serum creatinine does not accurately reflect the GFR in a patient with unstable kidney function.
3. Renal failure can be classified as oliguric or nonoliguric based on the urine output. Cutoffs of 500 mL/d or 25 mL/h for 4 hours are frequently used.

### Etiology
_Prerenal disease_

Prerenal disease characterized by preserved intrinsic renal function in the setting of renal hypoperfusion and reduced GFR. Possible causes include:

1. Decrease of effective arterial volume:
    - Hypovolemia
    - Congestive heart failure
    - Sepsis
    - Hepatic cirrhosis (can progress to hepatorenal syndrome)
2. Renal vasoconstriction can be caused by:
    - Hepatorenal syndrome (Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, overdiuresis, gastrointestinal bleeding, large volume paracentesis without volume expansion, or systemic bacterial infections can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhotic patients.)
    - Hypercalcemia
    - Drugs: NSAIDs, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, contrast, and calcineurin inhibitors
3. Obstruction of large vessels:
    - Renal artery stenosis
    - Venous thromboembolus, vasculitis or dissection of large vessels that supply kidney
    - Abdominal compartment syndrome: an intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg, measured via a pressure transducer attached to the bladder catheter, suggests the diagnosis.

_Intrinsic disease_

Intrinsic renal disease involves the glomeruli, microvasculature, tubules, or interstitium of the kidneys. Possible causes include:

1. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN):
    - Ischemic ATN
    - Toxic ATN can results from drugs (ex. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin), pigments (ex. hemoglobin, myoglobin), light chain of immunoglobulin, or crystals (ex. uric acid, methotrexate, acyclovir, indinavir).
    - Contrast-induced acute kidney injury
2. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN):
    - Allergy caused by beta-lactams, sulfa drugs, NSAIDs, or proton pump inhibitors
    - Pyelonephritis
    - Infection, such as leptospirosis, TB, or legionella
    - Infiltrative diseases result from sarcoid, lymphoma, or leukemia
    - Autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, TINU syndrome (tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis), systemic lupus erythematosus, IgG4-related diseases
3. Obstruction of small/medium vessels:
    - Cholesterol emboli
    - Polyarteritis nodosa
    - Thrombotic microangiopathy: hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, preeclampsia, antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome, malignant hypertension, or scleroderma renal crisis
4. Glomerulonephritis

_Postrenal disease_

Postrenal disease involves obstruction of the urinary collecting system. Bilateral involvement or unilateral obstruction to a solitary kidney is required to produce a significant change in creatinine level. Possible causes include:

1. Obstruction at bladder neck:
    - Benign prostate hyperplasia
    - Prostate cancer
    - Neurogenic bladder
    - Anticholinergic medications
2. Ureteral obstruction:
    - Malignancy
    - Lymphadenopathy
    - Retroperitoneal fibrosis
    - Nephrolithiasis

### Manifestations
_Prerenal disease_

- When the cause is true volume depletion, presentation involves history of excessive fluid loss, reduced intake or orthostatic symptoms. The physical exam may reveal dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and orthostatic signs (drop in blood pressure > 20/10 mmHg or an increase in heart rate by 10 bpm after standing from a seated/lying position). The central venous pressure is typically less than 8 cmH2O.

_Postrenal disease_



### Diagnosis
- Most causes of postrenal disease are identified on ultrasound by dilation of the collecting system. Be aware that hydronephrosis may be less pronounced when there is concomitant volume depletion or if peritoneal fibrosis has encased the ureters, preventing their expansion.
- When urethral flow is impeded by prostatic enlargement, placement of a bladder catheter can be both diagnostic and therapeutic; a postvoid residual urine volume > 300 mL strongly suggests the diagnosis.

### Treatment
- Hepatorenal syndrome: Management of the the renal disease is supportive. Temporizing measures include treatment of the underlying precipitating factor (ex. peritonitis) and withholding diuretics. Dialytic support can be used as a bridge to transplantation in appropriate candidates.
- In heart failure, diuresis may improve the prerenal azotemia.
- When the upper urinary tract is obstructed, decompression is necessary, with stenting or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
- Relief of bilateral obstruction is frequently followed by postobstructive diuresis. Serum electrolytes need to be monitored if polyuria ensues, and replacement of approximately half of the urinary volume with 0.45% saline is recommended.
