### Introduction
- Hyerkalemia is defined as a plasma potassium > 5.0 mEq/L.
- Pseudohyperkalemia represents an artificially elevated plasma potassium due to potassium movement out of cells immediately before or following venipuncture. Contributing factors include repeated fist clenching, hemolysis, and marked leukocytosis or thrombosis.

### Etiology
True hyperkalemia occurs as a result of:
_Transcellular shift_

1. Metabolic acidosis other than organic acidosis due to lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis
2. Insulin deficiency
3. Drugs: non-selective beta-blockers, digitalis, and depolarizing muscle relaxants (ex. succinylcholine)
4. Massive cellular necrosis: tumor lysis, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, ischemic bowel disease
5. Exercise-induced hyperkalemia
6. Familial periodic paralysis

_Decreased renal potassium excretion (most common)_

1. Decreased GFR: oliguric/anuric acute kidney injury or end stage renal disease
2. Normal GFR: 
    - Normal aldosterone function: Congestive heart failure and cirrhosis can result in decreasing effective arterial volume, which subsequently leads to limited potassium excretion. Ureterojejunostomy can cause absorption of urinary potassium in jejunum.
    - Hypoaldosteronism: Decreased renin function can result from diabetic nephropathy, NSAIDs medication, chronic interstitial nephritis, HIV infection. Decreased aldosterone synthesis can result from adrenal deficiency or usage of angiotencin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor inhibitor, ketoconazole and heparin. Aldosterone insensitivity can be caused by medications including potassium-sparing diuretics, TMP-SMX, pentamidine, and calcineurin inhibitors (ex. cyclosporine); or tubulointerstitial disease such as sickle cell anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, amyloidosis, and diabetes mellitus.

### Manifestations
- The most severe effect of hyperkalemia is arrhythmia. Patients may present with palpitations, syncope, or even sudden cardiac death.
- Features of ECG might include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, increased QRS width, loss of P wave, sine wave pattern or even pulseless electrical activity and ventricular fibrillation. Since the sensitivity of these ECG patterns is low, cardiac arrest might be first electrical manifestation.
- Severe hyperkalemia causes partial depolarization of the skeletal muscle cell membrane and may manifests as weakness, potentially progress to flaccid paralysis and hypoventilation.
- Other: nausea and paresthesia
