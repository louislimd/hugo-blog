### Introduction
- Hyerkalemia is defined as plasma potassium > 5.0 mEq/L.
- Pseudohyperkalemia represents an artificially elevated plasma potassium due to potassium movement out of cells immediately before or following venipuncture. Contributing factors include repeated fist clenching, hemolysis, and marked leukocytosis or thrombosis.

### Etiology
True hyperkalemia occurs as a result of:

_Transcellular shift_

1. Metabolic acidosis other than organic acidosis due to lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis
2. Insulin deficiency
3. Drugs: non-selective beta-blockers, digitalis, and depolarizing muscle relaxants (ex. succinylcholine)
4. Massive cellular necrosis: tumor lysis, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, ischemic bowel disease
5. Exercise-induced hyperkalemia
6. Familial periodic paralysis

_Increased exposure to potassium (rare)_

Foods with a high content of potassium include salt substitutes, dried fruits, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, spinach, bananas, and oranges.

_Decreased renal potassium excretion (most common)_

1. Decreased GFR: oliguric/anuric acute kidney injury or end stage renal disease
2. Normal GFR: 
    - Normal aldosterone function: Congestive heart failure and cirrhosis can result in decreasing effective arterial volume, which subsequently leads to limited potassium excretion. Ureterojejunostomy can cause absorption of urinary potassium in jejunum.
    - Hypoaldosteronism: Decreased renin function can result from diabetic nephropathy, NSAIDs medication, chronic interstitial nephritis, HIV infection. Decreased aldosterone synthesis can result from adrenal deficiency or usage of angiotencin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor inhibitor, ketoconazole and heparin. Aldosterone insensitivity can be caused by medications including potassium-sparing diuretics, TMP-SMX, pentamidine, and calcineurin inhibitors (ex. cyclosporine); or tubulointerstitial disease such as sickle cell anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, amyloidosis, and diabetes mellitus.

### Manifestations
- The most severe effect of hyperkalemia is arrhythmia. Patients may present with palpitations, syncope, or even sudden cardiac death.
- Features of **ECG** might include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, increased QRS width, loss of P wave, sine wave pattern or even pulseless electrical activity and ventricular fibrillation. Since the sensitivity of these ECG patterns is low, cardiac arrest might be first electrical manifestation.
- Severe hyperkalemia causes partial depolarization of the skeletal muscle cell membrane and may manifests as weakness, potentially progress to flaccid paralysis and hypoventilation.
- Other: nausea and paresthesia

### Diagnosis
1. **Pseudohyperkalemia** should be excluded by rechecking laboratory data.
2. Rule out **transcellular shift**.
3. Assess **GFR**; if normal, assess renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis:
    - Low aldosterone levels: adrenal disease (high renin levels) or hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (low renin levels; occurs with type 4 RTA, chloride shunting or Gordon syndrome).
    - High aldosterone levels suggest aldosterone resistance (typically high renin levels) but can also seen in potassium-sparing diuretics.

### Treatment
> Note!
>
> 1. Severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes is a medical emegency.
> 2. Calcium helps prevent/treat cardiac complications, therefore it should be initial therapy (especially when ECG is abnormal).
> 3. Treatment that eliminates total body potassium essential (ex. Kayexalate, diuretics, and dialysis) will wear off with time.

_Acute therapy_

1. **Calcium gluconate**:
    - Dose: 10 mL of a 10% solution infused over 2~3 minutes
    - Onset: less than 3 minutes
    - Calcium decreases membrane excitability but does not lower potassium.
    - The effect begins within minutes but is short-lived (30~60 minutes), and the dose can be repeated if no improvement in the ECG after 5~10 minutes.
2. **Insulin**:
    - Dose: 10~20 units of regular insulin + 25~50g of glucose (adding dextrose)
    - Onset: 15~30 minutes
    - Insulin drives potassium into cells.
    - Insulin should be given alone if the serum glucose is above 250 mg/dL
3. **Kayexalate**:
    - Dose: 25~50 g mixed with 100 mL 20% sorbitol (PO; sorbitol for preventing constipation); 50 g resin in 150 mL tap water (PR)
    - Onset: 1~2 hours
    - Cation exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate promote the exchange of sodium for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract.
    - Generally lower potassium by 0.5~1.0 mEq/L and last for 4~6 hours.
    - Enemas should be avoided in post-operative patients because of the increased incidence of colonic necrosis, especially after renal transplantation.
    - Newer agent: sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
4. Bicarbonate:
    - Dose: 3 ampules of sodium bicarbonate in 1L of 5% dextrose
    - Onset: 15~30 minutes
    - Especially effective for hyperkalemia associated with metabolic acidosis.
    - Exchange potassium for proton in cells.
5. Beta2-agonists (albuterol):
    - Dose: 10~20 mg in 4 mL of saline by nebulization over 30~60 minutes; 0.5 mg IV
    - Onset: 30~90 minutes
    - Beta2-agonists drive potassium into cells and lower potassium by 0.5~1.5 mEq/L.
    - The effect last for 2~4 hours.
6. Diuretics (furosemide):
    - Dose: >=40 mg IV
    - Onset: 30 minutes
    - Increasing distal sodium delivery in the kidney enhances renal potassium clearance.
    - Should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment.
7. Hemodialysis should be reserved for patients with renal failure, severe life-threatening hyperkalemia, or those who are refractory to other conservative measures.

_Chronic therapy_

- Dietary modification for reducing potassium intake
- Correction of metabolic acidosis with oral alkali
- Diuretics
- Administration of mineralocorticoid in case of hypoaldosteronism
