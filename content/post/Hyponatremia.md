### Introduction
- Hyponatremia is defined as plasma sodium < **135 mEq/L**.
- **Pseudohyponatremia** refers to a laboratory phenomenon by which a high content of plasma proteins and lipids expands the nonaqueous portion of the plasma sample. This can be averted with sodium-sensitive electrodes.
- Any process that limits the elimination of water or expands the volume around a fixed sodium content may lead to hyponatremia.

### Etiology
_Hyponatremia with high serum osmolality_

1. Hyponatremia with high serum osmolality is most often due to **hyperglyemia**, which results in a fall of plasma sodium of 1.6~2.4 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL rise in plasma glucose.
2. Other causes include administration of **mannitol**.
3. Pathophysiology: The rise in serum osmolality pulls water out of the cells, thereby lowering the serum sodium concentration by dilution.

_Hyponatremia with normal serum osmolality_

Possible causes include:

1. **Pseudohyponatremia**
2. Post-transurethral resection of the prostate (post-TURP) syndrome: Solutes such as glycine or sorbitol can be absorbed into the extracellular fluid during bladder irrigation, leading to transient hyponatremia.

_Hyponatremia with low serum osmolality_

1. Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - **Congestive heart failure**
    - **Cirrhosis**
    - Severe **nephrotic syndrome**
    - **Advanced renal failure**
2. Euvolemic hyponatremia
    - **Primary polydipsia**: massive water intake (usually > 12L/day) exceed the capacity of secretion, since urine cannot be diluted to an osmolality less than approximately 60 mOsm/L
    - **Beer potomania** or "**tea and toast**" diet: solute-poor diet leads to insufficient body solute to excrete water intake
    - **Syndrome of inappropriate ADH** (SIADH): This disorder is caused by the nonphysiological release of vasopressin. Common causes include neuropsychiatric disorders (ex. meningitis, encephalitis, acute psychosis, cerebrovascular accident, head trauma, hydrocephalus, Guillan-Barre syndrome), pulmonary diseases (ex. pneumonia, tuberculosis, aspergillosis, positive-pressure ventilation, asthma, COPD, pneumothorax), malignancy (ex. mostly small-cell lung cancer), drugs (ex. antipsychotics, SSRIs, chemotherapy, arginine vasopressin, MDMA, NSAIDs, chlorpropamide), and other conditions such as pain or postoperative state.
    - **Endocrinopathies**: glucocorticoid deficiency (leads to co-secretion of ADH and CRH), hypothyroidism/myxedema coma (leads to decreased cardiac output and GFR)
    - **Reset osmostat** is a phenomenon in which the set point for plasma osmolality is reduced. This phenomenon occurs in almost all pregnant women, and those with chronic malnutrition or chronic decreased effective ciculating volume.
3. Hypovolemic hyponatremia
    - Renal losses: diuretics (especially **thiazides**), **salt-wasting nephropathy**, **cerebral salt wasting** (ANP secretion), **mineralocorticoid deficiency**, ketonuria, bicarbonaturia (from vomiting-induced contraction alkalosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis)
    - Extrarenal losses: GI losses (ex. diarrhea), third-spacing (ex. pancreatitis)

### Manifestations
1. The clinical features are related to the osmotic intracellular water shift leading to cerebral edema. Therfore, the symptoms are primarily **neurologic**.
2. **Acute hyponatremia** (developing in less than 2 days):
    - Plasma sodium less than 125~130 mEq/L: nausea and malaise
    - Plasma sodium less than 115~120 mEq/L: headache, lethargy, obtundation and eventually stupor, seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest.
3. **Chronic hyponatremia** (more than 3 days in duration): adaptive mechanisms minimize the symptoms

### Diagnosis
_Workup_

1. Ask history:
    - Acute or chronic (> 48 hours)?
    - Severity of symptoms
    - Evaluate risk for neurologic complications, such as alcoholism, malnutrition, cirrhosis, older females on thiazides, hypoxia, and hypokalemia
2. Measure serum **osmolality**
    - High serum osmolality (> **290 mOsm/L**): Consider hyperglycemia and mannitol administration
    - Normal serum osmolality (**275~290 mOsm/L**): Consider pseudohyponatremia and post-TURP syndrome
    - Low serum osmolality (< **275 mOsm/L**): Continue to next step.
3. For hyponatremia with low serum osmolality, check **volume status**:
    - Vital signs
    - Orthostatics
    - Jugular vein pressure
    - Skin turgor
    - Mucous membranes
    - Peripheral edema
    - BUN and creatinine
    - Uric acid
4. Measure **urine osmolality** and **urine sodium concentration**
5. Differential dignosis of hypotonic hyponatremia is described in following section.

_Hyponatremia with low serum osmolality_

1. Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - **Urine Na > 20 mEq/L**, **FENa > 1%**: Consider advanced renal failure
    - **Urine Na < 10 mEq/L**, **FENa < 1%**: Consider congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome
2. Euvolemic hyponatremia
    - **Urine osmolality > 100**: Consider SIADH, endocrinopathies
    - **Urine osmolality < 100**: Consider primary polydypsia, beer potomania, "tea and toast" diet
    - Reset omostat: urine osmolality is variable
3. Hypovolemic hyponatremia
    - **Urine Na > 20 mEq/L**, **FENa > 1%**: Consider renal losses
    - **Urine Na < 10 mEq/L**, **FENa < 1%**: Consider extrarenal losses

### Treatment
_General principles_

1. Therapy depends on volume status, acuity, and whether the hyponatremia is symptomatic or not.
2. **Frequent lab examination** and IV fluid rate adjustment is necessary.
3. The risks of correcting hyponatremia too rapidly are volume overload and the development of **central pontine myelinolysis** (CPM).
    - Symptoms: paraplegia, dysarthria, and dysphagia
    - Risk factors: correction of hyponatremia > **10~12 mEq/L within 24 hours**, preexisting hypokalemia, malnutrition, alcoholism
    - CPM can be confirmed by CT scan or MRI of brain.
    - Once present, CPM should be emergently reversed by DDAVP (desmopressin) with or without D5W.

_Symptomatic hyponatremia_

1. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated promptly with **hypertonic** saline; however any saline solution that is **hypertonic to the urine** can increase serum sodium when oral water intake is restricted.
2. Severe hyponatremia, in whom an immediate correction is necessary, should be corrected **1~2 mEq/L/hour for 3~4 hours** until symptoms are resolved. However, this initial correction should be tapered off once the patient is safe, such that the rise in serum sodium does not exceed 10~12 mEq/L within 24 hours.
3. The following equation is often used to approximate the change in sodium concentration in mEq/L from the infusion of 1 L of fluid:`Increase in serum [Na] = (Infusate [Na + K] - Serum [Na])/(TBW + 1)`. TBW is estimated by multiplying the lean weight (in kilograms) by 0.6 in men (and 0.5 in women). Dividing the `desired rate of correction (mEq/L/h)` by `increase in serum [Na] (mEq/L/L of fluid)` gives you the **rate of administration**.

_Asymptomatic hyponatremia_

1. Chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia
    - The risk of iatrogenic injury is increased in patients with chronic hyponatremia.
    - We suggest a more modest rate of correction on the order of **5~8 mEq/L over a 24-hour period**.
2. Hypovolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia
    - **Isotonic** saline can be used to restore the intravascular volume.
    - Restoration of a euvolemic state will reduce the impetus toward renal water retention, leading to normalization of sodium concentration.
    - The equation described earlier can be used to calculate the expected change from 1 L of 0.9% normal saline.
3. Hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia
    - For hyponatremia in congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, treatment requires management of the underlying condition.
    - **Water restriction**: oral fluid intake should be less than daily urine output.
    - Urinary excretion of water can be promoted through the use of **loop diuretics**.
    - **Tolvaptan** (vasopressin antagonist) may be helpful, particularly in congestive heart failure.
    - When using medications to promote water loss, laboratory data and volume status must be followed extremely closely, because the effect cannnot be predicted.

_SIADH_

1. First-line therapy is **water restriction** and **treating underlying cause** (ex. nausea, pneumonia, drugs, etc.). A useful guide to the necessary degree of fluid restriction is as follows:
    - If (Urine Na + Urine K)/Serum Na < **0.5**, restrict to **1 L/day**.
    - If (Urine Na + Urine K)/Serum Na is **0.5~1.0**, restrict to **500 mL/day**.
    - If (Urine Na + Urine K)/Serum Na > **1**, the patient has a negative renal free water clearance and is actively reabsorbing water. Consider other options to enhance water excretion.
2. If first-line therapy fails or if the patient is symptomatic, the following can be attempted to promote water excretion.
    - **Hypertonic saline** (consider first): 1 L hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) will raise serum sodium by about 10 mEq; 50 ml/hour will raise serum sodium by about 0.5 mEq/L/hour; 100~200 ml/hour will raise serum sodium by about 1~2 mEq/L/hour. Check serum sodium every 2 hours, since formula only provides estimate.
    - **High dietary solute load**: high-salt, high-protein diet or administration of oral urea (30~60 g)
    - **Vasopressin antagonists**: Conivaptan (IV) and tolvaptan (PO) can be used for symptomatic SIADH resistant to above modalities. Since rate of correction can be rapid, these agents should be initiated in a closely monitored inpatient setting.
    - Lithium and demeclocycline (rarely used) interfere with the collecting tubule's ability to respond to ADH. Since the side effects are significant, they should only be considered in severe hyponatremia that is unreponsive to more conservative measures.
