### Introduction
- Hypokalemia is defined as plasma potassium < 3.5 mEq/L.
- Spurious hypokalemia may be seen when high numbers of metabolically active cells present in the blood sample and absorb extracellular potassium.

### Etiology
True hypokalemia occurs as a result of:

_Transcellular shift_

Movement of potassium into cells may result from:

1. Alkalemia
2. Insulin
3. Catecholamine release
4. Periodic paralysis: Both hyperkalemic and hypokalemic forms can be triggered after strenuous exercise (the hypokalemic form can also be triggered after a carbohydrate-rich meal).
5. Acute increase in hematopoiesis (ex. megaloblastic anemia treated with vit. B12, AML crisis)
6. Hypothermia
7. Chloroquine
8. Barium/cesium intoxication
9. Antipsychotics overdose: risperidone, quetiapine

_Diminished intake (rare)_

Diminished intake is seldom the sole cause, but dietary potassium restriction may exacerbate hypokalemia from GI or renal loss.

_GI potassium loss_

1. Upper gastrointestinal losses
    - **Vomiting** and **nasogastric tube drainage** usually manifest as renal potassium losses due to **secondary hyperaldosteronism** and **metabolic alkalosis**.
2. Lower gastrointestinal losses
    - Possible causes include **diarrhea**, **laxative abuse**, and **villous adenoma**.
    - Hypokalemia from lower gastrointestinal losses are typically associated with **bicarbonate wasting** and hyperchloremic **metabolic acidosis**.

_Renal potassium loss_

Renal potassium loss accounts for most cases of chronic hypokalemia. Possible causes include:

1. Hypotensive or normotensive:
    - Acidosis: diabetic ketoacidosis, renal tubular acidosis (type 2 and some type 1)
    - Alkalosis: diuretics, vomiting/nasogastric tube drainage
    - Bartter's syndrome: loop of Henle dysfunction leads to furosemide-like effect
    - Gitelman's syndrome: distal convoluted tubule dysfunction leads to thiazide-like effect
    - Magnesium deficiency
2. Hypertensive: mineralocorticoid excess
    - Primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocortical hyperplasia, Conn's syndrome (adrenal adenoma)
    - Secondary hyperaldosteronism: edema disorder (ex. cardiac failure, nephrotic syndrome), renovascular hypertension, renin-secreting tumor, pregnancy
    - Other: Cushing's syndrome, Liddle's syndrome (constitutive activation of the distal renal epithelial sodium channel), exogenous mineralocorticoid, congenital adrenal hyperplasia

### Manifestations
- Symptoms seldom occur unless the plasma potassium is less than 3.0 mEq/L.
- Possible manifestations: nausea, vomiting, ileus, weakness and muscle cramps (especially lower extremities), polyuria; rhabdomyolysis, complete paralysis, hypoventilation can occur in severe cases.
- ECG changes: flattening or inversion of the T wave, a prominent U wave, ST-segment depression, and a prolonged QT interval; or even prolonged PR interval, decreased voltage, widening of the QRS complex, and ventricular ectopy (premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation)
- **Periodic paralysis**: In both hyperkalemic and hypokalemic forms, a later onset proximal myopathy develops, most commonly affecting the pelvic girdle and the lower extremities.

### Diagnosis
_Workup_

1. Rule-out transcellular shifts
2. Check urine potassium:
    - Urinary potassium excretion can be measured with a 24-hour urine collection or estimated by multiplying the spot urine potassium concentration by the total daily urine output.
    - Transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG), which estimates the potassium gradient between the urine and blood in the distal nephron, can be calculated as follows: TTKG = (Urine K+/Serum K+)/(Urine Osmolality/Serum Osmolality).
    - 24-hour urine potassium less than **25 mEq/day**, spot urine potassium concentration less than **5 mEq/L**, or TTKG less than **3** suggest **nonrenal potassium loss**.
    - 24-hour urine potassium more than **30 mEq/day**, spot urine potassium concentration more than **15 mEq/L**, or TTKG more than **7** suggest **renal potassium loss**.
3. If hypokalemia is caused by renal loss, check acid-base status and blood pressure.

### Treatment
1. Oral therapy:
    - It is generally safer when hypokalemia is mild and the patient can tolerate oral administration.
    - Oral doses of **40 mEq** can be given every **4 hours**. Traditionally, **10 mEq** of potassium salts are given for each **0.10 mEq/L** decrement in serum potassium.
2. IV therapy:
    - Patients with life-threatening hypokalemia and those who are unable to take anything by mouth require IV replacement therapy with KCl.
    - KCl should be mixed in normal saline because dextrose solutions may initially exacerbate hypokalemia.
    - **1 mEq/L** decrement of serum potassium approximately equal to **200 mEq/L** total body potassium loss.
    - The rate of infusion should not exceed **20 mEq/hour** unless paralysis or malignant ventricular arrhythmias are present. Rates above 20 mEq/L are highly irritating, therefore such high rates should be infused into a large central vein or into multiple peripheral veins. Initial rates as high as 40 mEq/hour have been used for life-threatening hypokalemia.

3. **Hypomagnesemia** should be sought and corrected (IV MgSO4 1~2 g q2h) to allow effective potassium repletion.
