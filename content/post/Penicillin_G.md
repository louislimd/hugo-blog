### Indications
_Bacteria_

1. Streptococci
2. Anaerobes (except Bacteroides fragilis): Approximately 20% of anaerobes infection is resistant to penicillin G.
3. Spirochetes
    - Treponema pallidum (syphilis)
    - Leptospira spp. (leptospirosis)

_Diseases_

1. Streptococcal infections: penicillin G is still the first-line therapy
    - Cellulitis
    - Erysipelas
    - Necrotizing fasciitis
2. Viridans streptococcal infections
3. Streptococcus pneumoniae infections
4. Enterococcal infections, such as urinary tract infection and endocarditis
5. Spirochetal infections
    - Syphilis
    - Leptospirosis
6. Actinomycosis
7. Gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens

### Dosage
- Unit: penicillin G 1 mu (million units) = 0.6 g

Table-1 Patients with normal kidney function

### Discussion
1. So far, penicillin G is still the first-line therapy for following infectious dieases:
    - Streptococcal infections
    - Viridans streptococcal infections
    - Syphilis
    - Leptospirosis
2. Do not give penicillin G at a dose more than **24 mu/day**. Usage of penicillin G > 30 mu/day might lead to central nervous system side effect, including myoclonus and seizure.
3. The half-life of penicillin G is only **30 minutes**. Therefore, the dosing interval should be every 4 hours (q4h), especially when penicillin G is used for treating severe infection (ex. bacterial endocarditis, bacterial meningitis, group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis).
4. When oral formulation of penicillin is indicated, **amoxicillin** might be a better choice compared to penicillin V. The reasons include:
    - The bioavailability of amoxicillin is better.
    - Amoxicillin can be given 2~3 times daily, while penicillin V have to be given 4 times per day.
5. **Benzathine penicillin G** is a long-acting IM repository form of penicillin that can be used in patients not able to complete the 10-days course of treatment. Indications of benzathine penicillin G include:
    - Early latent syphilis (< 1 year duration): 2.4 mu IM in one dose
    - Late latent syphilis (unknown duration or > 1 year): 2.4 mu IM weekly for 3 doses
    - Acute group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis: 1.2 mu IM in one dose
    - Prophylaxis for rheumatic fever, recurrent group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, and recurrent streptococcal soft-tissue infections

### Adverse effect
Rare anaphylactic reactions typically occur within **30 minutes** after exposure to penicillin G. Therefore, patients administered with penicillin G should be under observation for 30 minutes after injection, especially in outpatient setting.
