### Introduction
Abscesses of the liver can be caused by different pathogen. Most of them are caused by bacteria or amoeba. **Bacterial abscesses** are the most common, whereas **amebic abscesses** are the second most common hepatic abscess and the most common abscess in the developing world.

### Etiology
_Bacterial abscesses_

1. Pathogen:
    - **Klebsiella pneumoniae** accounts for most of the liver abscesses in Taiwan. Abscesses caused by K. pneumoniae are especially common in those with **type 2 diabetes mellitus**.
    - Other: Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Enterococcus
    - Staphylococcus should be considered if the patient had received invasive treatment such as transaretrial chemoembolization (TACE).
2. Route of infection:
    - Approximately half of the cases are idiopathic.
    - Infection via biliary tract is common.
    - Portal vein bacteremia may be caused by pelvic infections or gastrointestinal infections (ex. diverticulitis, appendicitis).
    - Trauma, such as penetration injury or blunt injury
    - Iatrogenic infection can be caused by percutaneous liver biopsy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD), transaretrial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI).
3. Risk factors: immunosuppression
    - Type 2 diabetes mellitus
    - Chemotherapy
    - Corticosteroid treatment

_Amebic abscesses_

1. Pathogen: Entamoeba histolytica
2. Route of infection: Entamoeba histolytica reaches the portal vein from intestinal amebiasis.

### Manifestations
_Bacterial abscesses_

1. Symptoms might include abdominal pain in right upper quadrant, fever, and hepatomegaly. Jaundice is not common, unless the liver abscess is combined with other biliary disease.
2. Some patients might manifested with non-specific symptoms such as fever and malaise. Therefore, differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin (FUO) should include liver abscess.
3. Liver abscesses caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae might accompany with endophthalmitis.
4. Right shoulder pain and cough can result from:
    - Irritation of diaphragm
    - Infection of pleura or lung

_Amebic abscesses_

1. Symptoms might include abdominal pain in right upper quadrant, fever, and hepatomegaly.
2. Only 10% of the patients are comorbid with acute dysentery.
3. Amebic abscesses are commonly locarted in right, upper, anterior portion of liver (near diaphragm). Multifocal lesion is common in Taiwan.
4. Most of the episodes are subacute onset.

### Diagnosis
> Note!
> 
> 1. Liver abscesses can be easily diagnosed with abdominal sonography.
> 2. Bacterial abscesses and amebic abscesses cannot be differentiated by clinical presentation. To differentiate them, following examinations are necessary:
>     - Culture and examination of fluid drained from abscesses
>     - Indirect hemagglutination test for amoeba

_Bacterial abscesses_

1. Send cultures of blood, pus, and bile in an aerobic-anaerobic pair.
2. Negative culture result may result from antibiotics administration previously.
3. Laboratory studies might reveal leukocytosis, elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and elevated CRP.

_Amebic abscesses_

1. Indirect hemagglutination test:
    - Sensitivity: 95%
    - Specificity: > 95%
    - The result can still be positive even after the infection had resolved for years.
2. Stool specimen:
    - Amoeba can be found in only about 50% cases.
    - More than 1 specimen may be necessary.
    - Amoeba in stool specimen is rarely found in those with early-stage amebiasis.
3. Colonoscopy
    - Do not ignore closed wound. Biopsy is necessary for any abnormal lesion.
4. The fluid drained from amebic abscesses is typically black, red, or brown in color, with high viscosity.

### Treatment
_Bacterial abscesses_

1. **Antibiotics**:
    - Empiric therapy include 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins + anti-anaerobic antibiotics (ex. metronidazole)
    - The antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted according to the culture result.
    - The antibiotics are typically administered for 2 weeks intravenously + 4 weeks orally.
2. **Drainage** is generally necessary.
    - Liver abscesses < 5 cm: intermittent echo-guided fine needle aspiration
    - Liver abscesses > 5 cm: drainage tube placement
3. Surgical intervention is not usually required.

_Amebic abscesses_

1. **Metronidazole**: 750 mg PO tid (Flagyl) or 500 mg IV q6h (Anegyn) for 7~10 days
    - Adverse effects: nausea, diarrhea, metallic taste, dizziness, urine color change, disulfiram-like reactions to alcohol
    - Alcohol intake is forbidden during treatment.
    - Contraindications include pregnancy and breastfeeding.
    - Consider terminating administration if neurologic symptoms present, especially in those with underlying neurologic disorder.
    - Imrovement is expected within 96 hours. Be aware of secondary infection or drug resistance if improvement is not observed after 96 hours.
2. **Luminal agents**:
    - Iodoquinol 650 mg PO tid for 20 days
    - Diloxanide furoate 500 mg tid for 10 days
    - Aminosidine 25~35 mg/kg dailly for 7~10 days
3. Amebic abscesses typically respond to medication well. Therefore, consider **drainage** only in following clinical settings:
    - No improvement after medication treatment > 5~7 days
    - Lesion located in left lobe, which can lead to pericardium involvement.
