### Introduction
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) includes both thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
<!--more-->
### Etiology
Causes include diarrheal bacterial toxins and medications (mitomycin C, clopidogrel, cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and it may be associated with pregnancy or malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. Atypical HUS has been described in patients with mutations in the genes coding for proteins that regulate the complement cascade, such as factor H and factor I. These patients have normal ADAMTS13 activity and do not have Shiga toxin-associated diarrhea.
### Manifestations

### Diagnosis

### Treatment
Eculizumab has been found to be a safe and effective way of treating atypical HUS.
