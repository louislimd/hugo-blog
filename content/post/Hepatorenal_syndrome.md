### Introduction

<!--more-->
### Etiology
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, overdiuresis, gastrointestinal bleeding, large volume paracentesis without volume expansion, or systemic bacterial infections can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhotic patients.

### Manifestations


### Diagnosis


### Treatment
Management of the renal disease is supportive. Temporizing measures include treatment of the underlying precipitating factor (ex. peritonitis) and withholding diuretics. Dialytic support can be used as a bridge to transplantation in appropriate candidates.
