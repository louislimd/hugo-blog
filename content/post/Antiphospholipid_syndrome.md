### Etiology

### Manifestations
APS may include other features, such as thrombocytopenia, valvular heart disease, livedo reticularis, neurologic manifestations, and neuropathy.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of APS requires the presence of at least one clinical and one laboratory criteria:

1. **Clinical criteria**:
    - Unprovoked arterial or venous thrombosis in any tissue or organ, or
    - Pregnancy morbidities: unexplained late fetal death (> **10 weeks**); premature birth (before 34 weeks) complicated by eclampsia, preeclampsia, placental insufficiency; or $\geq$3 unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions at < **10 weeks** of gestation.
2. **Laboratory criteria**: presence of antiphospholipid autoantibodies, on two or more occasions at least **12 weeks** apart and no more than 5 years prior to clinical manifestations. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies include:
    - Lupus anticoagulant (LA)
    - Anticardiolipin
    - $\beta$2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies
