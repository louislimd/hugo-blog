### Introduction
_Definition_

1. Proximal **deep vein thrombosis (DVT)** occur in or superior to the popliteal vein (or the confluence of tibial and peroneal veins), whereas distal DVTs occur inferiorly.
2. **Pulmonary embolism (PE)** can be classified as central/proximal (main pulmonary artery, lobar, or segmental) or distal (subsegmental).
3. Thrombophlebitis consists of inflammation in a vein due to a blood clot.

_Epidemiology_

- Without treatment, half of patients with proximal lower extremity DVT develop PE.
- DVTs in the upper extremities are often related to an indwelling catheter and can cause PE.
- DVT may occur concomitantly with superficial thrombophlebitis.

### Etiology

_Overview_

1. Venous thromboemboli arise under conditions of **blood stasis**, **hypercoagulability**, or venous **endothelial dysfunction/injury** (Virchow's triad).
    - Stasis: bed rest, inactivity, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident within 3 months, air travel > 6 hours
    - Endothelial injury: trauma, surgery, prior DVT, inflammation
    - Hypercoagulable state
2. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in association with varicose veins, trauma, infection, and hypercoagulable disorders.
3. Other causes of pulmonary arterial occlusion include in situ thrombi (ex. sickle cell disease), marrow fat embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, pulmonary artery sarcoma, and fibrosing mediastinitis.

_Risk factors_

1. Inherited disorders are suggested by spontaneous VTE at young age (< 50 years), recurrent VTE, VTE in first-degree relatives, thrombosis in unusual locations (ex. abdominal), and recurrent fetal loss. For example:
    - Gene mutations: **factor V leiden**, **prothrombin G20210A**
    - Deficiencies of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III
    - Homocystinuria: a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of cystathionine-$\beta$-synthase. Mild elevation of homocysteine may be caused by a mutation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), but does not cause VTE.
2. Acquired disorders:
    - Malignancy
    - Infection
    - Collagen vascular diseases
    - Nephrotic syndrome
    - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
    - Drug: hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, raloxifene, oral contraceptives
    - [Antiphospholipid syndrome]()
3. Other:
    - Spontaneous VTE in unusual locations, such as cavernous sinus, mesenteric vein, or portal vein, may be the initial presentation of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) or myeloproliferative disorders.
    - Spontaneous (idipathic) VTEs have a high risk of recurrence (8~10% per year) regardless of the presence of an inherited thrombophilia.

### Manifestations
_Deep vein thrombosis_

1. Pretest assessment (Simplified Wells score) of the probability of a DVT provides useful information.![](/img/VTE_2.png)
2. Symptoms: calf pain, swelling (> 3 cm compared with unaffected side), redness, warmth, venous distention, tenderness, palpable cord
3. Physical exmination: Homan's sign positive (calf pain on dorsiflexion, seen in less than 5% of patients)
4. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens may occur in severe cases.
5. About 50% of patients with symptomatic DVT have asymptomatic PE.

_Superficial thrombophlebitis_

Superficial thrombophlebitis presents as a tender, warm, erythematous, and often palpable thrombosed vein.

### Diagnosis
_Deep vein thrombosis_


_Pulmonary embolism_

### Treatment
_Prophylaxis in different situations_

1. Low-risk; same-day sugery and younger than 40-year-old: early, aggressive ambulation
2. Minor surgery in mobile patient: mechanical prophylaxis
3. High-risk (ex. immobilized, history of VTE, thrombophilia or cancer), most surgery: unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 units SC q12h or q8h, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH); enoxaparin, 40 mg SC daily, or dalteparin 5000 units SC daily; or fondaparinux 2.5 mg SC daily; or mechanical prophylaxis (especially if high risk of bleeding)
4. Orthopedic surgery: low-molecular-weight heparin (or fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, warfarin [INR 2~3]) for 35 days + mechanical prophylaxis

> Note!
> 
> Aspirin alone is not sufficient for prophylaxis.
