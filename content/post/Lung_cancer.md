### Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. 

### Etiology
Smoking is the greatest risk factor for lung cancer, with ~90% of cases being tobacco-related. Other risk factors include exposure to asbestos and radon. 

Lung cancer can be classified into two major types: non-small-cell lung cancer (~85% of primary malignancy) and small-cell lung cancer (~15% of primary malignancy).

_Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)_

1. Adenocarcinoma:
	- Now the most common lung carcinoma.
    - Lesions are typically located in the periphery.
    - Genetic features: mutations in KRAS, EGFR (especially female, Asian and non-smokers), HER2; rearrangement in ALK, ROS1, and RET.
2. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC):
	- Second most common subtype.
    - Squamous cell carcinoma is highly associated with exposure to tobacco smoke.
    - Most occur centrally in the lung fields.
    - Genetic features: mutations in FGFR1, TP53, and CDKN2A.
3. Large-cell carcinoma:
    - Large-cell carcinoma is undifferentiated malignancy.
    - Peripheral lesions are more common.
4. Other

_Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)_

Small-cell lung cancer is associated with a rapid tumor growth and early metastases compared to NSCLC. Genetic features of SCLC include frequent mutations in TP53 and RB. Lesions are typically located centrally. In addition, SCLC shows the strongest association with smoking.

### Manifestation
About 10% of patients are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally by imaging.

_Pulmonary symptoms_

Endobronchial growth of local lesion can cause **cough**, **dyspnea**, **hemoptysis**, wheezing, and obstructive pneumonia. Theses manifestations are more common in SCC and SCLC, which are located centrally.

_Regional spread_

- Intrathoracic extension might cause pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy), dysphagia (esophageal compression), stridor (tracheal obstruction), and chest wall pain.
- **Pancoast tumor**: apical tumor results in shoulder pain from invasion of muscle, atrophy of hand muscles and radicular arm pain caused by **brachial plexus involvement** (C8, T1, T2), and **Horner syndrome** (ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, and anhidrosis).
- **Superior vena cava syndrome**: compression of SVC might cause face or arm swelling, venous distension of neck and shoulder wall, dyspnea, cough, and headache. These symptoms can be relieved by steroid, diuretics and radiotherapy (most of the malignancies causing SVC syndrome are radiation sensitive!). SVC stent can be used for severe symptoms. If thrombus is present, anticoagulation should be considered.

_Extrathoracic metastases_

Lung cancer can spread hematogenously to brain, liver, bone, and adrenal gland.

_Paraneoplastic syndromes_

- Small-cell lung cancer: **Cushing's syndrome** (ACTH), **SIADH** (ADH), **Eaton-Lambert syndrome**
- Squamous cell carcinoma: **hypercalcemia** (PTH-rP)
- Adenocarcinoma: **hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy** (symmetric polyarthritis and proliferative periostitis of long bones), hypercoagulable state
- Carcinoid tumor: **Cushing's syndrome** (ACTH)
- Other paraneoplastic syndromes: digital clubbing, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar degeneration, limbic  encephalitis, acanthosis nigricans, dermatomyositis, DIC, and marantic endocarditis.

### Diagnosis
_Screening_

- No benefit to chest X-ray or sputum cytology, even in high-risk patients. A normal chest X-ray does not exclude lung cancer.
- Any patient with a smoking history and concerning pulmonary symptoms should undergo a **low-dose chest CT-scan**.

_Diagnostic and staging evaluation_

1. Initial imaging: The following features should prompt further evaluation for lung cancer.
	- Chest radiograph demonstrates a new or enlarging focal lesion, a pleural effusion, pleural nodularity, enlarged hilar or paratracheal nodes, endobronchial lesion, post-obstructive pneumonia or segmental/lobar atelectasis.
    - CT findings suggestive of malignancy in a patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule include large lesion (> 15 mm), irregular or spiculated borders, upper lobe location, thick-walled cavitation, presence or development of a solid component within a ground glass lesion, and detection of growth by follow-up imaging. Multiple nodules in a patient with a known or suspected extrathoracic malignancy strongly suggests pulmonary metastasis.
2. Tissue: A diagnosis of lung cancer should not be made without definitive pathology. Modalities include:
	- **Bronchoscopy** with endobronchial ultrasound-directed biopsy (for central lesions).
    - Ultrasound/CT-guided **needle biopsy** (for peripheral lesions). Core needle biopsy is preferable to fine-needle aspiration.
    - **Transbronchial needle aspiration** obtains mediastinal lymph nodes for pathologic examination and aids in staging.
    - **Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)**
    - Thoracentesis is typically performed first for evaluation of pleural effusions. Pleural biopsy is often performed when pleural fluid cytology is negative or to obtain tissue from a solid pleural lesion.
3. Evaluation of extrathoracic metastasis:
	- **PET-CT** is more sensitive than CT alone
    - **Brain MRI** for all patients except those with stage IA cancer.
4. **Genetic testing** for EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement is important for treatment of stage IV non-squamous NSCLC.
5. Pulmonary function test might be useful for predicting lung function after resection. The result of PFTs should be above 30% predicted.

### Treatment
_NSCLC_

1. **Stages I & II**: Surgical resection + adjuvant chemotherapy (platinum-based doublet) is prefered. Radiation therapy is an option for those who are not candidates for surgical resection.
2. **Stage III**: Chemoradiation is main modality. Stage IIIA tumor is viewed as resectable, while stage IIIB tumor is unresectable. Neuadjuvant chemoradiatio may convert unresectable tumor to resectable one.
3. **Stage IV**:
	- Chemotherapy (platinum-based doublet): cisplatin/pemetrexed is better for adenocarcinoma; cisplatin/gemcitabine is better for squamous cell carcinoma
    - EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib and afatinib should be considered as frontline therapy in patients whose tumors harbor activating mutations in EGFR.
    - Crizotinib and ceritinib are TKIs effective in patients with tumors harboring the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Crizotinib is also associated with marked clinical activity in tumors harboring ROS1 rearrangement.
    - TKI toxicities include rash and diarrrhea; lung and liver injury are rare bu potentially serious.
    - Nivolumab (targeting PD-1 receptor) has been approved for patients with previously treated metastatic SCC.
    - Radiation therapy and surgery may be useful for symptom palliation.

_SCLC_

SCLC is a disseminated diease in most patients at presentation and is very responsive to chemotherapy.

1. **Limited stage (stages I to III)**: The standard therapy is concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy with a platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin) plus etoposide. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) decreases the incidence of brain metastases and improves survival.
2. **Extensive stage (stage IV)**: Chemotherapy with a platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin) plus etoposide. Radiation therapy, including both prophylactic cranial radiation and thoracic RT, may be benificial in patients with a complete or partial response to their initial chemotherapy.
