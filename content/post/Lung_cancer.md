### Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. 

### Etiology
Smoking is the greatest risk factor for lung cancer, with ~90% of cases being tobacco-related. Other risk factors include exposure to asbestos and radon. 

Lung cancer can be classified into two major types: non-small-cell lung cancer (~85% of primary malignancy) and small-cell lung cancer (~15% of primary malignancy).

_Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)_

1. Adenocarcinoma:
	- Now the most common lung carcinoma.
    - Lesions are typically located in the periphery.
    - Genetic features: mutations in KRAS, EGFR (especially female, Asian and non-smokers), HER2; rearrangement in ALK, ROS1, and RET.
2. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC):
	- Second most common subtype.
    - Squamous cell carcinoma is highly associated with exposure to tobacco smoke.
    - Most occur centrally in the lung fields.
    - Genetic features: mutations in FGFR1, TP53, and CDKN2A.
3. Large-cell carcinoma:
    - Large-cell carcinoma is undifferentiated malignancy.
    - Peripheral lesions are more common.
4. Other

_Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)_

Small-cell lung cancer is associated with a rapid tumor growth and early metastases compared to NSCLC. Genetic features of SCLC include frequent mutations in TP53 and RB. Lesions are typically located centrally. In addition, SCLC shows the strongest association with smoking.

### Manifestation
About 10% of patients are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally by imaging.

_Pulmonary symptoms_

Endobronchial growth of local lesion can cause **cough**, **dyspnea**, **hemoptysis**, wheezing, and obstructive pneumonia. Theses manifestations are more common in SCC and SCLC, which are located centrally.

_Regional spread_

- Intrathoracic extension might cause pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy), dysphagia (esophageal compression), stridor (tracheal obstruction), and chest wall pain.
- **Pancoast tumor**: apical tumor results in shoulder pain from invasion of muscle, atrophy of hand muscles and radicular arm pain caused by **brachial plexus involvement** (C8, T1, T2), and **Horner syndrome** (ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, and anhidrosis).
- **Superior vena cava syndrome**: compression of SVC might cause face or arm swelling, venous distension of neck and shoulder wall, dyspnea, cough, and headache. Theses symptoms can be relieved by steroid, diuretics and radiotherapy (most of the malignancies causing SVC syndrome are radiation sensitive!). SVC stent can be used for severe symptoms. If thrombus is present, anticoagulation should be considered.

_Extrathoracic metastases_

Lung cancer can spread hematogenously to brain, liver, bone, and adrenal gland.

_Paraneoplastic syndromes_

- Small-cell lung cancer: **Cushing's syndrome** (ACTH), **SIADH** (ADH), **Eaton-Lambert syndrome**
- Squamous cell carcinoma: **hypercalcemia** (PTH-rP)
- Adenocarcinoma: **hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy** (symmetric polyarthritis and proliferative periostitis of long bones), hypercoagulable state
- Carcinoid tumor: **Cushing's syndrome** (ACTH)
- Other paraneoplastic syndromes: digital clubbing, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar degeneration, limbic  encephalitis, acanthosis nigricans, dermatomyositis, DIC, and marantic endocarditis.
