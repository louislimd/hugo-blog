### Indications (similar with amoxicillin)
_Bacteria_

1. Gram positive cocci:
    - Streptococci
    - Viridans streptococci
    - Streptococcus pneumoniae
    - Enterococci
2. Listeria monocytogenes
3. Escherichia coli: More than 70% of E. coli infection is resistant to ampicillin.
4. Proteus mirabilis: More than 60% of P. mirabilis infection is resistant to ampicillin.
5. Haemophilus influenzae: More than 60% of H. influenzae infection is resistant to ampicillin.
6. Salmonella spp.: More than 40% of Salmonella infection is resistant to ampicillin.
7. Shigella spp.

_Diseases_

1. Listeria monocytogenes infections
2. Enterococcal infections:
    - Urinary tract infection
    - Endocarditis
3. Shigellosis: Only oraly formulated ampicillin is indicated for shigellosis.
4. Ampicillin can be used to treat following diseases, as long as the infecion is proved to be sensitive to ampicillin.
    - Escherichia coli
    - Proteus mirabilis
    - Haemophilus influenzae
    - Salmonella spp.

### Discussion
> Note: Comparison between amoxicillin and ampicillin
> 
> 1. Oral bioavailability:
>     - Amoxicillin: 90%
>     - Ampicillin: 40%
> 2. Dosing interval:
>     - Amoxicillin: q8h (the half life is approximately 1.7 hours)
>     - Ampicillin: q6h (the half life is approximately 1 hour)
> 3. The serum concentration of amoxicillin is 2~2.5 times as much as ampicillin does if both of them are administered with same dosage. Therefore, amoxicillin can replace ampicillin in most clinical scenarios except treating shigellosis.
> 4. Do not use amoxicillin for treating shigellosis, even if the susceptibility test is proved to be positive. The concetration of amoxicillin in gastrointestinal tract is low, since most of the amoxicillin is absorped.

Generally, ampicillin is only indicated for following infections:

1. **Enterococcal infections**:
    - Ampicillin is the first-line therapy.
    - When antibiotics are indicated for enterococcal infections, ampicillin and amoxicillin are better choice compared to penicillin G.
2. **Listeria monocytogenes infections**: Ampicillin is the first-line therapy
3. **Shigellosis**: Only oraly formulated ampicillin is indicated for shigellosis.

### Adverse effect (similar with amoxicillin)
1. **Anaphylactic reactions**
2. **Diarrhea**:
    - It is more common in ampicillin administration, compared to amoxicillin.
    - Since the oral bioavailability of amoxicillin is better than ampicillin, the concentration of amoxicillin in bowel lumen is lower.
3. **Maculopapular rash**:
    - The incidence of maculopapular rash is > 70% when ampicillin or amoxicillin is administered in patients with the following diseases: **infectious mononucleosis** caused by EBV, mononucleosis-like syndrome caused by CMV, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hyperuricemia treated with allopurinol.
