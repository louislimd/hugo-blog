### Introduction
1. Normal range:
    - pH range: **7.36~7.44**
    - PaCO2: **35~45 mmHg**
    - Bicarbonate: **22~26 mEq/L**
    - PaO2: 80~100 mmHg
    - SaO2: 95~100%
    - Anion gap: **12 $$\pm$$ 2 mEq/L**
2. Perturbations in pH is described by the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**: pH = 6.1 + log([HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]/[PaCO<sub>2</sub> x 0.3])
3. Compensation:
    - **Chemical buffering** is mediated by bicarbonate in the extracellular fluid and by protein and phosphate buffers in the intracellular fluid. It acts immediately after acid base disturbance.
    - **Respiratory** compensation acts within minutes and minimizes pH variation by altering PaCO2.
    - **Renal** compensation acts about 6 hours after alkalosis or acidosis. Kidneys can adapt to pH variation via bicarbonate reabsorption and excretion of titratable acid (ex. H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.
    - Compensation never fully corrects pH. If pH is normal, consider mixed disorder.

### Diagnosis
1. Determine **primary disorder** by checking pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.![](/img/Acid_base_3.png)
2. Determine whether **compensation** is appropriate. An inappropriate compensation suggests the presence of mixed disorder.![](/img/Acid_base_4.png)
3. Determine the **anion gap (AG)**
    - **AG = [Na<sup>+</sup>] - ([Cl<sup>-</sup>] + [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>])**
    - AG is a way of demonstrating the accumulation of unmeasured anions. Certain forms of acidosis are characterized by an increase in the pool of unmeasured anions (ex. sulfates, phosphates, proteins, and organic acids).
    - AG should be corrected if there are gross changes in serum albumin levels: **AG<sub>correct</sub> = AG + {(4 - [albumin]) x 2.5}**.
