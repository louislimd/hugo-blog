### Introduction
1. Normal range:
    - pH range: **7.36~7.44**
    - PaCO2: **35~45 mmHg**
    - Bicarbonate: **22~26 mEq/L**
    - PaO2: 80~100 mmHg
    - SaO2: 95~100%
    - Anion gap: **10~14 mEq/L**
2. Perturbations in pH is described by the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**: pH = 6.1 + log([HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]/[PaCO<sub>2</sub> x 0.3])
3. Compensation:
    - **Chemical buffering** is mediated by bicarbonate in the extracellular fluid and by protein and phosphate buffers in the intracellular fluid. It acts immediately after acid base disturbance.
    - **Respiratory** compensation acts within minutes and minimizes pH variation by altering PaCO2.
    - **Renal** compensation acts about 6 hours after alkalosis or acidosis. Kidneys can adapt to pH variation via bicarbonate reabsorption and excretion of titratable acid (ex. H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.
    - Compensation never fully corrects pH. If pH is normal, consider mixed disorder (more than one primary disorder at the same time).
4. ABG vs VBG:
    - ABG and VBG are concordant for pH (~0.04) and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (~2 mEq), but not PaCO<sub>2</sub> (~8&\pm&17 mmHg).
    - VBG can be used to screen for hypercarbia with PaCO<sub>2</sub> at cutoff &\geq& 45 mmHg, but does not accurately assess degree of hypercarbia.

### Etiology
1. Pathophysiology of acid-base disturbances:
    - Metabolic acidosis: gain of H<sup>+</sup> or loss of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
    - Metabolic alkalosis: gain of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or loss of H<sup>+</sup>
    - Respiratory acidosis: hypoventilation
    - Respiratory alkalosis: hyperventilation
2. Some important clinical settings that may lead to mixed disorders:
    - Respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis: cardiopulmonary arrest, severe lung edema, drug intoxication combined respiratory depression
    - Respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis: liver failure combined with diuretics usage, ventilator usage combined with nasogastric tube drainage or vomiting
    - Respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis: septic shock, renal failure combined with sepsis, salicylates intoxication
    - Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease combined with diuretics usage
    - Acute respiratory acidosis and chronic respiratory acidosis: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease combined with infection
    - Metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis: renal failure combined with vomiting, vomiting combined with hypotension (ex. lactic acidosis)

> Note!
> 
> Respiratory acidosis (hypoventilation) and respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) cannot occur simultaneously.

### Manifestations
Consequences of severe acid-base disturbances:

1. Acidemia (pH < 7.20)
    - Cardiovascular system: decreased contractility, arteriolar vasodilation, decreased mean arterial pressure, decreased cardiac output, decreased response to catecholamines, increased risk of arrhythmias
    - Respiratory system: hyperventilation, decreased respiratory muscle strength
    - Metabolism: increased serum potassium level, insulin resistance
    - Neurologic system: change of mental status
2. Alkalemia (pH > 7.60)
    - Cardiovascular system: arteriolar vasoconstriction, decreased coronary blood flow, increased risk of arrhythmias
    - Respiratory system: hypoventilation
    - Metabolism: decrease of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate level in serum
    - Neurologic system: change of mental status, seizure, tetany

### Diagnosis
> Note: Mixed disorder can also manifest with normal pH value!
> 
> 1. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis: normal pH but PaCO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> are both increased
> 2. Respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis: normal pH but PaCO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> are both decreased
> 3. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis: normal pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>; but the anion gap is increased
> 4. Non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis (or actually no disturbance): pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and anion gap are all normal

_Workup_

1. Determine **primary disorder** by checking pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.![](/img/Acid_base_1.png)
2. Determine whether **compensation** is appropriate. An inappropriate compensation suggests the presence of mixed disorder.![](/img/Acid_base_2.png)
3. Assess the **anion gap** and the **delta gap** ([calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/anion-gap)) if the main problem is metabolic acidosis. Assess the **alveolar-arterial gradient** ([calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/a-a-o2-gradient)) instead if the main problem is respiratory acidosis.
4. To differentiate the cause leading to the primary disorder, refer to the specific diseases:
    - [Metabolic acidosis](https://louislimd.github.io/2017/03/26/metabolic_acidosis/)
    - [Metabolic alkalosis](https://louislimd.github.io/2017/03/26/metabolic_alkalosis/)
    - [Respiratory acidosis](https://louislimd.github.io/2017/03/26/respiratory_acidosis/)
    - [Respiratory alkalosis](https://louislimd.github.io/2017/03/26/respiratory_alkalosis/)

_Anion gap (AG)_

- **AG = [Na<sup>+</sup>] - ([Cl<sup>-</sup>] + [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>])**
- AG is a way of demonstrating the accumulation of unmeasured anions (UA). Certain forms of acidosis are characterized by an increase in the pool of UA (ex. sulfates, phosphates, proteins, and organic acids).
- AG should be corrected if there are gross changes in serum albumin levels: **AG<sub>correct</sub> = AG + {(4 - [albumin]) x 2.5}**.

_Delta gap_

1. To maintain a stable total anion content, every increase in an UA should be met with a decrease in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>].
2. Interpretation:
    - If the delta gap = **1~2**, this is a pure AG metabolic acidosis.
    - If the delta gap < **1**, this is an AG metabolic acidosis and simultaneous non-AG metabolic acidosis.
    - If the delta gap > **2**, this is an AG metabolic acidosis and simultaneous metabolic alkalosis.

_Alveolar-arterial gradient: P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub>_

- The P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> is useful in determining the source of hypoxemia.
- Calculation: P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> = PAO<sub>2</sub> - PaO<sub>2</sub> = [F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(P<sub>atm</sub> - P<sub>water saturation</sub>) - PaCO<sub>2</sub>/respiratory qoutient] - PaO<sub>2</sub> = [F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(760 - 47) - PaCO<sub>2</sub>/0.8] - PaO<sub>2</sub>
- Simplified version: **P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> = (F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub> x 713 - PaCO<sub>2</sub> x 1.25) - PaO<sub>2</sub>**
- The normal value of P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> is about 10 mmHg. Generally, it increases with age. A conservative estimate of normal P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> is < **(Age/4) + 4**.
