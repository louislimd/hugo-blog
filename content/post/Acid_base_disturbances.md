### Introduction
1. Normal range:
    - pH range: **7.36~7.44**
    - PaCO2: **35~45 mmHg**
    - Bicarbonate: **22~26 mEq/L**
    - PaO2: 80~100 mmHg
    - SaO2: 95~100%
    - Anion gap: **8~14 mEq/L**
2. Perturbations in pH is described by the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**: pH = 6.1 + log([HCO3-]/[PaCO2 x 0.3])
3. Compensation:
    - **Chemical buffering** acts immediately and is mediated by bicarbonate in the extracellular fluid and by protein and phosphate buffers in the intracellular fluid.
    - **Respiratory** compensation acts within minutes and minimizes pH variation by altering PaCO2.
    - **Renal** compensation acts about 6 hours after alkalosis or acidosis. Kidneys can adapt to pH variation via bicarbonate reabsorption and excretion of titratable acid (ex. H2PO4-) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.
    - Compensation never fully corrects pH. If pH is normal, consider mixed disorder.

### Diagnosis
1. Determine **primary disorder** by checking pH, PaCO2, HCO3-.![](/img/Acid_base_3.png)
2. Determine whther **compensation** is appropriate. An inappropriate compensation suggests the presence of mixed disorder.

3. Determine the **anion gap (AG)**, which is a way of demonstrating the accumulation of unmeasured anions. Certain forms of acidosis are characterized by an increase in the pool of unmeasured anions (ex. sulfates, phosphates, proteins, and organic acids). AG = [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]).
