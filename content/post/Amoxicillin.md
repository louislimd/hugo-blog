### Indications
_Bacteria (similar with ampicillin)_

1. Gram positive cocci:
    - Streptococci
    - Viridans streptococci
    - Streptococcus pneumoniae
    - Enterococci
2. Listeria monocytogenes
3. Escherichia coli
4. Proteus mirabilis
5. Haemophilus influenzae
6. Salmonella spp.
7. Helicobacter pylori
8. Neisseria gonorrhoeae

_Diseases_

1. Streptococcal infections:
    - Group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis
    - Cellulitis, impetigo, erysipelas
2. Enterococcal infections
3. Amoxicillin can be used as empiric therapy for following respiratory tract infections:
    - Acute bacterial sinusitis
    - Acute otitis media
4. Amoxicillin can be used as empiric therapy (combined with metronidazole) for dental infections.
5. Helicobacter pylori infection can be treated with amoxicillin + clarithromycin + proton pump inhibitors.

### Discussion
> Note: Comparison between amoxicillin and ampicillin
> 
> 1. Oral bioavailability:
>     - Amoxicillin: 90%
>     - Ampicillin: 40%
> 2. Dosing interval:
>     - Amoxicillin: q8h (the half life is approximately 1.7 hours)
>     - Ampicillin: q6h (the half life is approximately 1 hour)
> 3. The serum concentration of amoxicillin is 2~2.5 times as much as ampicillin does if both of them are administered with same dosage. Therefore, amoxicillin can replace ampicillin in most clinical scenarios except treating shigellosis.
> 4. Do not use amoxicillin for treating shigellosis, even if the susceptibility test is proved to be positive. The concetration of amoxicillin in gastrointestinal tract is low, since most of the amoxicillin is absorped.

_S. pneumoniae infections_

1. High-dose amoxicillin is the only beta-lactam therapy that is effective for treating **S. pneumoniae infections**. 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins cannot be used in this clinical scenario.
2. Since **respiratory tract infections** are commonly caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, high-dose amoxicillin or Augmentin can be appropriate empiric therapy. 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins can only be used if the empiric therapy is failed, because it suggests that the respiratory tract infections might be caused by H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.

_Dental infections_

1. Empiric therapy for dental infections:
    - Amoxicillin + metronidazole
    - 1<sup>st</sup> generation cephalosporins + metronidazole
    - Amoxicillin-clavulanate
2. Rationale:
    - Amoxicillin (or 1<sup>st</sup> generation cephalosporins) is effective against viridans streptococci, streptococci, anaerobic cocci (ex. Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus); but is ineffective against Bacteroides, since Bacteroides produces beta-lactamase.
    - Metronidazole is effective against Bacteroides, but is ineffective against anaerobic cocci.
    - Amoxicillin-clavulanate is effective against Bacteroides, therefore it can be used for treating dental infections without combining metronidazole.
    - Clindamycin is no longer adequate for treating dental infections.
3. Choosing regimen:
    - Amoxicillin + metronidazole is ineffective against S. aureus.
    - 1<sup>st</sup> generation cephalosporins + metronidazole is effective against S. aureus.
    - Efficacy: Amoxicillin-clavulanate > 1<sup>st</sup> generation cephalosporins + metronidazole > amoxicillin + metronidazole.

### Adverse effect (similar with ampicillin)
1. **Anaphylactic reactions**
2. **Diarrhea**:
    - It is more common in ampicillin administration, compared to amoxicillin.
    - Since the oral bioavailability of amoxicillin is better than ampicillin, the concentration of amoxicillin in bowel lumen is lower.
3. **Maculopapular rash**:
    - The incidence of maculopapular rash is > 70% when ampicillin or amoxicillin is administered in patients with the following diseases: **infectious mononucleosis** caused by EBV, mononucleosis-like syndrome caused by CMV, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hyperuricemia treated with allopurinol.
