### Introduction

<!--more-->
### Etiology

### Manifestations
- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN): A nephritic picture is common, with RBC casts, edema, and hypertension.

### Diagnosis
- The finding of dysmorphic urinary RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria in the nephrotic range (> 3.5 g/day) stromgly suggests the presence of a glomerular disease.
- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN): A renal biopsy may reveal the specific underlying disease, but crescent formation in > 50% of glomeruli is usually present.

### Treatment
- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN): For those deemed to have salvageable renal function, management is with high-dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy (IV methylprednisolone 7~15 mg/kg/day for 3 days) followed by a course of oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 1 month, then tapered over the next 6~12 months). Cyclophosphamide is typically added to this regimen, with monthly IV doses (1 g/m^2) having less cumulative toxicity than the daily oral dosing strategy (2 mg/kg/day).
